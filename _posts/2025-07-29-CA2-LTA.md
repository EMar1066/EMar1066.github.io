## Preface

## a) Understanding of teaching, learning and/or assessment processes
### Case 1 - Lecturer in Civil Engineeirng & Programme Lead Water, Waste and Environmental Engineering (MSc)

I have developed, revised and dlivered numerous classes, including Numerical Methods for Civil Engineers, Chemistry for Civil Engineering, professional Skills


Learning is an active process in his approach of engaging me in constructing my own, original knowledge [16]. It showed me that education is not merely the transfer of knowledge—it is the opening of vistas, a shared journey of discovery. This was apparent also in his teaching techniques, such as using blank handouts with the exception of key headings, all in his own handwriting.

“There’s value in putting pen to paper. People remember what they write in their own hand.” During lectures, he completed slides as he spoke and the class followed along, studying without knowing it, considering what they were writing, provoking conversation as they read the work of their own pen, reflecting Vygotsky’s idea of learning as a socially constructed process “You should move logical progressions along slowly,” he advised, “being descriptive enough to make sure your class always knows where you’re going. There’s power in students reaching conclusions on their own—it’s your job to give them just enough to lead them there.” His methods translated mentorship to the classroom scale.



### Reflection
### Evidence
#### Contaminant Hydrogeology and Groundwater Remediation
> "The coursework was interesting as the integration of real life scenario in the coursework was good for learning."
> "The Lecturer consistently fosters an inclusive environment and goes above and beyond to ensure we have a strong understanding of
the module."
> "The model fosters critical thinking, and the examples the professor provides helped bridge the gap between what I’m reading and what
to expect in industry"

#### Hydrosystems Engineering and Managment (MSc)
> "Loved the teaching methodology of Dr Eric Martin will hope to learn more from him in future and work under his supervision to deepen
and enhance more knowledge."

#### Environment and Earth Materials (BSc)
>"The tutorial after each lecturer really helps to understand what is the purpose of what is being taught"

## b) Understanding my target learners
### Case 1 - Technology in the Classroom to Promote Engagement

### Reflection
Many of our students have never known a world without screens. For some, the first interface wasn’t a book or a toy—it was a touchscreen, a glowing rectangle handed to them in a pram. A bright and colourful featuring cartoon host with a high-pitched voice. A video that played again, and again, and again. These weren’t neutral tools. From the start, they were designed to hold attention—to compete, successfully, with toys, conversation, even comfort. The battle for screen time begins early. And it is meticulously engineered.

The platforms we give children are not passive. They’re built by behavioural designers and UX teams, optimised for a single metric: time on screen. Infinite scroll, autoplay, push notifications—none of it is incidental. These design choices exploit neurological reward loops, encouraging compulsive use (van Koningsbruggen et al., 2020). Studies link early exposure to changes in the brain, especially in areas governing attention and impulse control (Children and Screens, 2021). These systems weren’t designed to teach. They were built to retain. I’ve come to see this as a key distinction when choosing tools for university learning: understanding how students’ attention has been shaped [K3], and using that awareness to make pedagogical decisions informed by both research and experience [V3].

Digital media didn’t just enter childhood. It colonised it. Every platform, every app, every algorithm is built on the same logic we traced earlier: broadcast, dressed as interactivity. But the loop is closed—engineered for stickiness, not understanding. What matters isn’t what you learn, but how long you stay. Just like junk food: brightly packaged, instantly gratifying, difficult to resist.

We’ve seen this before. Over the past century, food products were engineered not for nourishment, but appeal. The “bliss point”—a calibrated mix of sugar, salt, and fat—activates reward systems and encourages repeat consumption. As Moss (2013) writes in Salt Sugar Fat, the goal was never nutrition. It was engagement.

These weren’t meals. They were edible interfaces—engineered to create habits. Over time, they reshaped not just the palate, but the expectation of food itself. Something wholesome might be better for you, but it wouldn’t “taste like anything.” Something meaningful might deserve your time, but it wouldn’t “hold you.”

A darker analogy lies in slot machines. Endless scroll, variable  rewards, instant feedback—platforms now borrow directly from the  heavily engineered behavioural logic of gambling. As Schüll (2012) documents in Addiction  by Design, casino systems weren’t built to excite, but to entrance. To  induce “the zone,” a trance of uninterrupted use. The goal isn’t joy.  Its continuity. 

The same logic now underpins digital media. Short loops. Bright visuals. Predictable payoffs. TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat—apps designed to train, not teach. You don’t have to like the content. You just have to keep scrolling.

It’s no accident we employ the word “users.” The word fits.

That same logic now underpins dashboards, polling  apps, push notifications. In using these delivery methods we are no longer teaching attention—we’re reconstructing the systems that dismantled it. It has reshaped how I think about attention.  The metrics behind it are behavioural, not cognitive: scroll depth, bounce rate, time to exit. And it’s not just youth. Anyone habituated within these systems carries that logic forward (Zuboff, 2019).

Educational software often patterns itself  after platform logic—we’re teaching inside it. Students may become fluent in engagement, but it’s behavioural, not reflective. They expect learning to feel like swiping. They expect the dopamine.  The platforms train students to expect novelty. The ed-tech industry knows this. 

Promoting engagement might make some sense in compulsory education. But at university, the contract changes. Adults bring their own engagement. That’s the pedagogical potluck. Students raised on platforms don’t arrive empty-headed—they arrive trained by their environments. Their habits, expectations, and sense of what “learning” feels like have been shaped—quietly, systematically—by technologies designed by platforms focused not on growth or education, but on user retention.

#### Contaminant Hydrogeology and Groundwater Remediation
> "The coursework was interesting as the integration of real life scenario in the coursework was good for learning."
> "The Lecturer consistently fosters an inclusive environment and goes above and beyond to ensure we have a strong understanding of
the module."
> "The model fosters critical thinking, and the examples the professor provides helped bridge the gap between what I’m reading and what
to expect in industry"
> "The professor (even though new to the university) brings in his experiences in the field while teaching. This helped me know the real
life applications and scenarios"

#### Hydrosystems Engineering and Managment (MSc)
>"I really enjoyed this course, and I can imagine how challenging it was to design and balance both the engineering and management
aspects of it, but the way it was delivered not only made the content engaging but it also encouraged a lot of critical thinking on my
part, which I really appreciated"

> "Loved the teaching methodology of Dr Eric Martin will hope to learn more from him in future and work under his supervision to deepen
and enhance more knowledge."

>"Eric Martin have Best teaching skills."

#### Environment and Earth Materials (BSc)
>"Dr Eric Martin has been a fantastic lecturer this term. It is a shame he will only be leading part of the course."

>"The tutorial after each lecturer really helps to understand what is the purpose of what is being taught"

#### Introduction to Solid and Fluid Mechanics
> "I stepped into fluid mechanics lectures expected to struggle a lot, however Eric made it seem
simple. His lectures were nice and short, yet very informative. The tutorial part of the lectures was enjoyable with both professors.
They were both willing to help out personally for each question, which was unexpected as other module professors don’t do it like that.
It gave me and other students and sense of care, which is very needed for a students benefits"

> "One of the lecturers actually gave us worksheets to work through in the tutorial which helped with the understanding and went around
to each person answering questions and checking the work"

> "I have found the fluids presentations well constructed and interesting - the lecturer has obviously made a lot of effort to make the
subject interesting and even fun. I also liked the fluids tutorial questions which were pitched at the right level for me."

> "St George's Centre does not allow for lecture recordings and the WiFi is not reliable, which means that attendance sometimes has to
be taken using paper. It is also very cold. It was not made for a lecture environment where one is sitting there for 3 hours (always have
felt compelled to put the coat back on because of this)."
