### Reflection
Many of our students have never known a world without screens. For some, the first interface wasn’t a book or a toy; it was a touchscreen. A glowing rectangle handed to them in a pram, a high-pitched app voiced by a cartoon, a video that played again, and again, and again. These weren’t neutral tools. From the start, they were built to capture and hold attention and to compete, highly successfully, with toys, conversation, even comfort. The battle for screen time begins early. 

The platforms that the current chohorts of univeristy students grew up with are not passive. They are the work of behavioural designers and UX teams, optimised for a single metric: Time on screen. Infinite scroll, autoplay, push notifications—none of it is incidental. These design choices exploit neurological reward loops, triggering dopamine and encouraging compulsive use (van Koningsbruggen et al., 2020). Studies link early screen exposure to structural changes in the brain, particularly in areas governing attention and impulse control (Children and Screens, 2021). These systems are not designed to teach. They are designed to retain.

Digital media didn’t merely enter childhood. It colonised it. Every platform, every app, every algorithm is built on the same logic we traced earlier: broadcast, dressed as interactivity. But it’s still a closed loop—engineered for stickiness, not understanding. What matters isn’t what you learn, but how long you stay. Just like junk food: brightly packaged, instantly gratifying, and difficult to resist.

An even darker analogy lies in the architecture of slot machines. Much of modern platform design: Endless scroll, variable rewards, instant feedback—borrows directly from the behavioural logic of gambling environments. As Natasha Schüll (2012) documents in Addiction by Design, Las Vegas systems were not built to excite, but to entrance. To induce “the zone,” a trance-like state of repetitive, uninterrupted use. The goal wasn’t joy. It was continuity. This same design ethos now underpins the student dashboard, the polling app, the push notification. The classroom has begun to mimic the casino: light cues, small wins, persistent pings. We are no longer teaching attention—we are reconstructing the very systems that dismantled it.

We’ve also seen this before in the food industry. Over the past century, processed products have been engineered not for nourishment, but for appeal. Food scientists discovered that the key to irresistible consumption wasn’t flavour, but chemistry. The “bliss point”—a precise combination of sugar, salt, and fat—activates the brain’s reward system, increasing cravings and fuelling repeat consumption. High-fructose corn syrup became ubiquitous not just because it was cheap, but because it made everything—drinks, sauces, snack bars—more addictive and shelf-stable. The result was a new kind of food: hyperpalatable, calorie-dense, and neurologically persuasive. As Michael Moss observes in Salt Sugar Fat, the goal was never nutrition. It was engagement.

This model has quietly reshaped how we think about attention. Engagement no longer implies curiosity or focus. It now means frictionlessness—seamless input, passive drift. The metrics behind it are behavioural, not cognitive: scroll depth, bounce rate, time to exit. And this isn’t just a story about young people. It’s about anyone whose habits were formed within systems designed not to develop attention, but to monetise it (Zuboff, 2019).
