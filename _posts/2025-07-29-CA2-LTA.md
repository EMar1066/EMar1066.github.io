## Preface

**Core Area 2a) Understanding of teaching, learning and/or assessment processes**

**Core Area 2a Case i: The Simplicity of a Smartboard**

In my lectures, I give students partial notes: a scaffold, not a script. Enough to follow, not enough to coast. I’ve found this helps students focus on core reasoning steps without getting lost in transcription—a method I’ve adopted to support active cognitive engagement, especially in concept-heavy sessions. It’s not just about delivery; it’s about designing material that invites participation without overstimulation. The aim is simple: to help students build understanding through their own written logic, not mine.  Fully notatated slides are uploaded after each class, along wiht a Panopto reording of the seseion to encourage in-person attendance in lectures, which has been shown to XXXXXX.  PART OF THIS MIGHT BE THAT STUDENTS ARE NOT ONLY LEARNING COURSE CONTENT, BUT ALSO LEARNING HOW TO ENGAGE WITH NEW MATERIALS; AN IMPOROPERLY CHOSEN DELIVERY METHOD WILL DISALLOW THE INSTRUCTOR FOR EFFECTIVLEY GUIDING STUDENTS IN THAT ENGAGEMENT.

This method was modelled for me during my education in Canada, where doctoral programmes are 5-7 years in length and operate under an apprenticehsip mode. As a PhD candidate, I watched my supervisor begin each lecture with handwritten skeletons of ideas—headings on acetate, nothing more. The rest unfolded in real time. “There’s value in putting pen to paper,” he told me. “People remember what they write in their own hand. They ask questions the moment they stop following.   If they have full notes in front of them, they will mentally disengage at the first inevitaable roadblock with a false feeling of secruity the notes give them.”  What he was doing wasn’t performative, but rather structural. A personal conversation scaled up to the capacity room.

That approach stayed with me. In my first lecture as an adjunct, chemistry, in front of 200 undergraduate engineers in 2017, I imitated him. Over time, I made it mine. I now use a hybrid structure: whiteboard logic, partial notes, deliberate pacing that was designed not just to present content, but to engage students in constructing it actively. It’s not flashy, but it works. Students aren’t just watching me, they’re actively building the argument line by line, with me, in real time.

One student emailed me after term end to say my lecture “somehow feels exactly how my brain wants to receive it.” They felt motivated to explore further. That feedback, and others like it, have reinforced the value of intentional structure. Not tools for their own sake, but design choices that foster space, focus, and trust in their own abilities and comprehension. Attention, developed through practice rather than simply and momentarily captured.

THE END RESULT WAS THE DEPLOYMENT OF A REDVELOPED CLASS THAT WAS SIGNFICANTLY MORE DIFFICULT AND TECHNICALLY RICH WITH NO DECREASE IN THE CLASS AVERAGE.  THE STUDENTS WERE FURTHER ENABLED BY TEACHING SRATEGIES THAT WERE CAREFULLY CHOSEN, AND THE TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS THAT MADE THAT POSSIBLE.

***Reflection***

The right tool is the one that sharpens thought. And sometimes the most radical instrument is also the oldest: the pen. Handwriting, as Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014) and Van der Meer & Van der Weel (2017) show, activates neural pathways that support understanding—not just transcription

IT FELT THAT WAY BECAUSE IT WANS KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY DISCOVERED AND WORKED THROUGH THEMSELVES....GUIDED MY MY LECTURE AND LINE BY LINE PROGRESSIONS. ANY ASPECTS THAT CAUSE CONFUSION IMMEIDDATLEY PROVOKE QUESTIONS

THE METHOD STOPS IS FROM BEING ONE WAY COMMUNICATION, THE WAY THAT RADIO WENT.  WE ARE ALL PRESENT SYNHRONOUSLY...WE ARE IN THE SAME ROOM. THESE THINGS DO MATTER

'evaluate how different subjects and instructional approaches might interact with online formats, considering the variable effects these might have on learning outcomes.'

***Core Area 2a Case ii: Large-Scale Gamification***

My teaching includes both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, and I have redeeveloped MSc level modules in contaminant hydrogeology and hydrosystems engineering and man-
agement. I previously lectured in Numerical Methods, Chemistry and Professional Skills for Civil Engineers at Queen’s, and later taught hydrogeology and water resources at University
of Birmingham. My teaching approach is structured and inclusive, combining scaffolded tutorial support with assessment formats that accommodate diverse academic backgrounds.
I also serve as an external assessor for Taighde Éireann (Research Ireland) and for the Ford Pro digital apprenticeship programme in software engineering.

I have developed, revised and dlivered numerous classes, including Numerical Methods for Civil Engineers, Chemistry for Civil Engineering, professional Skills

EVERYTHING GOES BACK TO HAVING AN ENGAGING NARRATIVE> AND I ASK MYSELF> DOES THIS TECHNOLOGY ACHIEVE THAT FOR ME?

SET UP AS PRACTICAL ASSIGNMENTS USING PRACTICAL TOOLS....EXCEL, GIS, GOOGLE EARTH API, GRACE DATA, PYTHON AND ORANGE ML.

***Reflection***

When we have a shared goal, we stay more enmgaged...When we're on oour phones pushing buttons, we are exteremely unengaged. 

***Evidence***

**Environment and Earth Materials (BSc)**

>"The tutorial after each lecturer really helps to understand what is the purpose of what is being taught"

**Contaminant Hydrogeology and Groundwater Remediation**

> "The coursework was interesting as the integration of real life scenario in the coursework was good for learning."


***Core Area 2a Case iii: External Examiner Role for DTS***

In addition to my course design, I am also an assessor for Postgraduate and Postdoctoral awards for Research Ireland, and most applicably, End-Point Assessor for The Digital 

### Evidence


> "The Lecturer consistently fosters an inclusive environment and goes above and beyond to ensure we have a strong understanding of
the module."

> "The model fosters critical thinking, and the examples the professor provides helped bridge the gap between what I’m reading and what
to expect in industry"

#### Hydrosystems Engineering and Managment (MSc)

> "Loved the teaching methodology of Dr Eric Martin will hope to learn more from him in future and work under his supervision to deepen
and enhance my knowledge."

## b) Understanding my target learners

**The Power of Simplicity: Whiteboard Use and Cognitive Development in HE**

I see learning is an active process in his approach of engaging in fundamental theory and the application of that theory to eventually create original knowledge.   The use of technology in the classroom can manifest at many different depths, and  my approach to teaching focuses on encouraging active engagement and critique of the material that is being presented. 
This is a case where the simplest of technologies has proven to be one of the most effective.

MY TEACHING PROCESSES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED SINCE 2017 TO REFLECT MY UNDERSTANDING OF TSUDENTS AND WHAT THEY WANT.   EVERY STUDENT WANTS GOOD GRADES AND FOR ASSIGNMENTS TO BE EASY TO APPROACH, BUT ULITMATELY THAT IS HOLLOW. WHAT THEY REMEMBER, AND WHAT STAYS WITH THEM IS OVERCOMING ADVERSITY...ITS LIKE SOMEONE GIVING YOU CANDY VS. WINNING THE BIG GAME AFTER TRAINING.  RATHTE RHTAN HANDING OUT CANDY, i HAVE ASPIRED TO BE THE COACH THTAT SHOWS THEM WHAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF, GIVEN A FOUNDATION OF THEORY AND THE RIGHT TOOLS.

STANDARD ACCESSIBLITY 

i ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT OBSTACLES CAN BE LESSEENED USING TODAY'S ED TECH, OFTEN IN THE SIMPLEST OF WAYS. WORKING IN ENGINEERING IS A SECOND LANGUAGE, AND IF ONE'S FIRST LANGUAGE IS NOT ENGLISH, IT BECOMES A SECOND LANGUAGE TWICE REMOVED.  OPEN ACCESS CANNON TEXTS, FREE OF CHARGE AND TRANSLATED TO MANY LANGUAGES 

ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE IN USING THE TOOLS, SOTCHASITC MODELING USING EXCEL.
MOODLE FORUMS, AND ALWAYS HAVE ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO CONGREGATE INDEPENDENTLY OF ME, EITHER IN PERSON, OVER SLACK OR MESSANGER

**Choosing Appropriate Technologies to Expand Attention, Increase Capability and Prepare Students for the Reality of Industry**

-I have to choose the technologies I use in class. I also havae a higher vantage poitn than they might.  I know exactly what awaits graduate engineers, and its not superiors who work hard on a daily basis to egnage with them.  its not colourful quizzes testing definitions.  Its problems that have little to no instruction, or even a set methodology and a boss that expects results.

> "The professor (even though new to the university) brings in his experiences in the field while teaching. This helped me know the real
life applications and scenarios"

#### Hydrosystems Engineering and Managment (MSc)
>"I really enjoyed this course, and I can imagine how challenging it was to design and balance both the engineering and management
aspects of it, but the way it was delivered not only made the content engaging but it also encouraged a lot of critical thinking on my
part, which I really appreciated"

#### Environment and Earth Materials (BSc)
>"Dr Eric Martin has been a fantastic lecturer this term. It is a shame he will only be leading part of the course."

>"The tutorial after each lecturer really helps to understand what is the purpose of what is being taught"

#### Introduction to Solid and Fluid Mechanics
> "I stepped into fluid mechanics lectures expected to struggle a lot, however Eric made it seem
simple. His lectures were nice and short, yet very informative. The tutorial part of the lectures was enjoyable with both professors.
They were both willing to help out personally for each question, which was unexpected as other module professors don’t do it like that.
It gave me and other students and sense of care, which is very needed for a students benefits"

> "One of the lecturers actually gave us worksheets to work through in the tutorial which helped with the understanding and went around
to each person answering questions and checking the work"

> "I have found the fluids presentations well constructed and interesting - the lecturer has obviously made a lot of effort to make the
subject interesting and even fun. I also liked the fluids tutorial questions which were pitched at the right level for me."
