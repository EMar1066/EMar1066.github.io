## Preface

***Core Area 2a: Teaching Experience and Curriculum Development***

The following section outlines my university-level teaching experience, developed across academic posts in both Canada and the UK. This includes my current role as Lecturer and MSc Programme Leader in Civil Engineering at University of Greenwich (2022-present), previous experience as a Teaching Fellow at University of Birmingham (2021-2022), and earlier experience as a Term Adjunct Lecturer at Queen’s University at Kingston (2017-2019). I have taught at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, led curriculum redevelopment, and supervised MSc research in the UK. These experiences have reinforced the importance of structured, context-rich teaching that supports technical learning and the  adoption of technology, as well as decision making, communication, and interdisciplinary engagement within engineering education

Across these roles, my teaching philosophy has crystallised around three central goals:

i) to deliver technically rigorous and applied engineering knowledge;

ii) to situate engineering practice within its environmental and societal context; and

iii) to foster creativity, communication, collaboration, and research independence as core professional skills.

At Queen’s, large lectures in civil engineering drew from outdated templates and static PDFs. With limited digital infrastructure and no institutional push toward TEL integration, I relied heavily on smartboard logic and partial note handouts. Students responded strongly to this low-tech approach—not because it was novel, but because it created space for pacing, reasoning, and co-construction of knowledge. This reinforced for me that clarity and structure matter more than polish—particularly in high-cognitive-load topics like hydrology, contaminant transport, numerical methods and fluid mechanics.

At Birmingham, the shift to hybrid delivery follwoing the pandemic prompted a deeper engagement with online tools. I implemented Panopto lecture capture, but resisted overuse of polling tools, having seen engagement fatigue surface early. In one module, I redesigned the assessment brief to simulate a real-world technical report with constraints drawn from client briefs—integrating both civil engineering judgement and communication clarity. Feedback from students highlighted how much they valued authenticity and pacing over digital flair.

***Core Area 2a: Current Role and Technoligal Integration***

In my current role I lead MSc Water, Waste & Environmental Engineering programme and I have  have redeveloped and led two Level-7 modules in the Civil Engineering programme: Contaminant Hydrogeology and Remediation (ENVI1195) and Hydrosystems Engineering and Management (CIVI1135).  I have also co-taught BEng modules including Introduction to Solid and Fluid Mechanics (GEEN1193) and Environment and Earth Materials (CIVI1158). Additionally, I have supervised MSc dissertation projects within the programme, which have uniquely focused on data driven engineering analyses using the tools most appropriate to both objectives and student capabilities.

My teaching approach now balances scaffolded interactivity with cognitive stretch. Where tools like Mentimeter and Moodle quizzes are used, they serve as entry points rather than substitutes for personal. More often, I use partial notes, Jupyter-based Python notebooks, and structured smartboard walkthroughs to build conceptual fluency. This hybrid method is grounded in constructivist pedagogy, but also shaped by my learners’ realities: varied levels of digital fluency, uneven preparedness, and often—especially in MSc contexts—a desire for practical relevance over abstraction.

The feedback for this method has been highly positive, as my line manager and Dupty Head of School reported that:

> "Eric has received excellent student evaluations in two of his modules that he leads..."He has demonstrated a strong commitment to teaching excellence. His module shells have been completed to a high standard."

While students have provided encouraging feedback on my technologically integrated appraoch as well:

> "Loved the teaching methodology of Dr Eric Martin will hope to learn more from him in future and work under his supervision to deepen and enhance my knowledge."

> "The Lecturer consistently fosters an inclusive environment and goes above and beyond to ensure we have a strong understanding of the module."

>"Dr Eric Martin has been a fantastic lecturer this term. It is a shame he will only be leading part of the course."

And with respect to an assignment that required MSc students to develop an analytica stochastic model for contaminant transport (ENVI-1195)

> "The model fosters critical thinking, and the examples the professor provides helped bridge the gap between what I’m reading and what to expect in industry"

My aim is to reflect the evolving demands and technical capabilites of engineering education, shaped by both my background in civil and environmental engineering and my earlier academic grounding in literature and narrative. I often structure lectures using frame narratives—embedding technical material within a contextual arc, a real-world scenario, or a slowly unfolding problem. This approach has proven especially effective in environmental engineering and hydrogeology, where systems are non-linear, consequences are distributed across time and space, and student intuition often needs scaffolding to grapple with delayed causality or layered complexity.



***Core Area 2a Case iii: External Examiner Role for DTS***

In addition to my course design, I am also an End-Point Assessor for Digital Technology Solutions (Software Engineering) apprenticeship programmes, engaging with professional learners and ensuring their assessment meets both industry and pedagogical standards. This work enhances my perspective on applied learning, outcomes-based evaluation, and the diverse educational trajectories within engineering.








***Reflection***

My approach to course delivery is shaped by a belief that university teaching should develop not only knowledge, but the habits of thought that allow students to reason, write, and judge with confidence. As John Henry Newman (1852) wrote, the purpose of higher education is to cultivate "a clear conscious view of one’s own opinions and judgments, a truth in developing them, an eloquence in expressing them, and a force in urging them." That intellectual development begins with structure: How ideas are presented, how arguments are built, and how students are invited to engage.
In my lectures, I combine partially completed slides with smartboard or visual work, using scaffolded notes to support active engagement rather than passive transcription. Students
receive partially completed slides before class, followed by full annotated notes after the session. This provides structure and accessibility while preserving the value of live note-
taking and class attendance. I open many lectures with a brief warm-up question using Menimeter, but do not rely on polling software to simulate engagement. Once discussion
begins, the tools recede and the focus shifts to handwritten development, shared logic, and real-time pacing.

I use smartboards and visual demonstrations frequently, particularly in concept-heavy courses such as fluid mechanics and environmental systems modelling. Handwritten work helps students follow reasoning step-by-step and has been shown to support deeper cognitive engagement than typed transcription (Mueller and Oppenheimer, 2014; Van der Meer and Van der Weel, 2017). In these settings, lectures are structured around shared questions, developed collectively. Informal check-ins, both verbal and visual, allow me to gauge pacing and understanding in real time. We pause, loop back, detour when needed. The narrative unfolds with the cohort, not ahead of it.

My use of technology in teaching is deliberate rather than decorative. I record lectures using Panopto and broadcast live via Teams when necessary. I have experience with Moodle, Canvas, and Desire2Learn, and routinely embed relevant datasets, journal articles, and walkthroughs to extend each session. In both BSc and MSc modules, I integrate Python, MODFLOW, and LARS-WG to support analytical work on groundwater flow, contaminant transport, and climate-affected recharge. These tools are not add-ons, but embedded in structured problem-solving exercises that emphasise iteration, uncertainty, and conceptual clarity. Assignments are paced to allow for exploration, error, and revision, reflecting the reality of engineering work. Laboratory and field sessions reinforce this approach. I have led practicals on pumping tests, slug tests, curve matching, and model calibration, ensuring that theoretical material is clealry connected to practical real-world systems. Collaborative learning is encouraged throughout. Students work together during assignments, discuss reasoning strategies in tutorials, and are invited to share approaches, not just results. The classroom is not treated as a delivery space but as a shared environment for building understanding. We are not there to watch slides. We are there to think-together.


When we have a shared goal, we stay more enmgaged...When we're on oour phones pushing buttons, we are exteremely unengaged.

***Core Area 2a Case i: The Simplicity of a Smartboard***

In my lectures, I give students partial notes: a scaffold, not a script. Enough to follow, not enough to coast. I’ve found this helps students focus on core reasoning steps without getting lost in transcription—a method I’ve adopted to support active cognitive engagement, especially in concept-heavy sessions. It’s not just about delivery; it’s about designing material that invites participation without overstimulation. The aim is simple: to help students build understanding through their own written logic, not mine.  Fully notatated slides are uploaded after each class, along wiht a Panopto reording of the seseion to encourage in-person attendance in lectures, which has been shown to XXXXXX.  PART OF THIS MIGHT BE THAT STUDENTS ARE NOT ONLY LEARNING COURSE CONTENT, BUT ALSO LEARNING HOW TO ENGAGE WITH NEW MATERIALS; AN IMPOROPERLY CHOSEN DELIVERY METHOD WILL DISALLOW THE INSTRUCTOR FOR EFFECTIVLEY GUIDING STUDENTS IN THAT ENGAGEMENT.

This method was modelled for me during my education in Canada, where doctoral programmes are 5-7 years in length and operate under an apprenticehsip mode. As a PhD candidate, I watched my supervisor begin each lecture with handwritten skeletons of ideas—headings on acetate, nothing more. The rest unfolded in real time. “There’s value in putting pen to paper,” he told me. “People remember what they write in their own hand. They ask questions the moment they stop following.   If they have full notes in front of them, they will mentally disengage at the first inevitaable roadblock with a false feeling of secruity the notes give them.”  What he was doing wasn’t performative, but rather structural. A personal conversation scaled up to the capacity room.

That approach stayed with me. In my first lecture as an adjunct, chemistry, in front of 200 undergraduate engineers in 2017, I imitated him. Over time, I made it mine. I now use a hybrid structure: smartboard logic, partial notes, deliberate pacing that was designed not just to present content, but to engage students in constructing it actively. It’s not flashy, but it works. Students aren’t just watching me, they’re actively building the argument line by line, with me, in real time.

One student emailed me after term end to say my lecture “somehow feels exactly how my brain wants to receive it.” They felt motivated to explore further. That feedback, and others like it, have reinforced the value of intentional structure. Not tools for their own sake, but design choices that foster space, focus, and trust in their own abilities and comprehension. Attention, developed through practice rather than simply and momentarily captured.


> "I have found the fluids presentations well constructed and interesting - the lecturer has obviously made a lot of effort to make the subject interesting and even fun. I also liked the fluids tutorial questions which were pitched at the right level for me."

> "One of the lecturers actually gave us worksheets to work through in the tutorial which helped with the understanding and went around
to each person answering questions and checking the work"

THE END RESULT WAS THE DEPLOYMENT OF A REDVELOPED CLASS THAT WAS SIGNFICANTLY MORE DIFFICULT AND TECHNICALLY RICH WITH NO DECREASE IN THE CLASS AVERAGE.  THE STUDENTS WERE FURTHER ENABLED BY TEACHING SRATEGIES THAT WERE CAREFULLY CHOSEN, AND THE TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS THAT MADE THAT POSSIBLE.

***Reflection***

The right tool is the one that sharpens thought. And sometimes the most radical instrument is also the oldest: the pen. Handwriting, as Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014) and Van der Meer & Van der Weel (2017) show, activates neural pathways that support understanding—not just transcription

IT FELT THAT WAY BECAUSE IT WANS KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY DISCOVERED AND WORKED THROUGH THEMSELVES....GUIDED MY MY LECTURE AND LINE BY LINE PROGRESSIONS. ANY ASPECTS THAT CAUSE CONFUSION IMMEIDDATLEY PROVOKE QUESTIONS

THE METHOD STOPS IS FROM BEING ONE WAY COMMUNICATION, THE WAY THAT RADIO WENT.  WE ARE ALL PRESENT SYNHRONOUSLY...WE ARE IN THE SAME ROOM. THESE THINGS DO MATTER 

MY TEACHING PROCESSES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED SINCE 2017 TO REFLECT MY UNDERSTANDING OF TSUDENTS AND WHAT THEY WANT.   EVERY STUDENT WANTS GOOD GRADES AND FOR ASSIGNMENTS TO BE EASY TO APPROACH, BUT ULITMATELY THAT IS HOLLOW. WHAT THEY REMEMBER, AND WHAT STAYS WITH THEM IS OVERCOMING ADVERSITY...ITS LIKE SOMEONE GIVING YOU CANDY VS. WINNING THE BIG GAME AFTER TRAINING.  RATHTE RHTAN HANDING OUT CANDY, i HAVE ASPIRED TO BE THE COACH THTAT SHOWS THEM WHAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF, GIVEN A FOUNDATION OF THEORY AND THE RIGHT TOOLS.

STANDARD ACCESSIBLITY 

i ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT OBSTACLES CAN BE LESSEENED USING TODAY'S ED TECH, OFTEN IN THE SIMPLEST OF WAYS. WORKING IN ENGINEERING IS A SECOND LANGUAGE, AND IF ONE'S FIRST LANGUAGE IS NOT ENGLISH, IT BECOMES A SECOND LANGUAGE TWICE REMOVED.  OPEN ACCESS CANNON TEXTS, FREE OF CHARGE AND TRANSLATED TO MANY LANGUAGES 

ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE IN USING THE TOOLS, SOTCHASITC MODELING USING EXCEL.
MOODLE FORUMS, AND ALWAYS HAVE ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO CONGREGATE INDEPENDENTLY OF ME, EITHER IN PERSON, OVER SLACK OR MESSANGER

***Core Area 2b Case i: Choosing Appropriate Technologies to Expand Attention, Increase Capability and Prepare Students for the Reality of Industry***

-I have to choose the technologies I use in class. I also havae a higher vantage poitn than they might.  I know exactly what awaits graduate engineers, and its not superiors who work hard on a daily basis to egnage with them.  its not colourful quizzes testing definitions.  Its problems that have little to no instruction, or even a set methodology and a boss that expects results.

***Core Area 2b Case iii: Large-Scale Gamification***

My teaching includes both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, and I have redeeveloped MSc level modules in contaminant hydrogeology and hydrosystems engineering and man-
agement. I previously lectured in Numerical Methods, Chemistry and Professional Skills for Civil Engineers at Queen’s, and later taught hydrogeology and water resources at University
of Birmingham. My teaching approach is structured and inclusive, combining scaffolded tutorial support with assessment formats that accommodate diverse academic backgrounds.
I also serve as an external assessor for Taighde Éireann (Research Ireland) and for the Ford Pro digital apprenticeship programme in software engineering.

I have developed, revised and dlivered numerous classes, including Numerical Methods for Civil Engineers, Chemistry for Civil Engineering, professional Skills


>"The tutorial after each lecturer really helps to understand what is the purpose of what is being taught"


EVERYTHING GOES BACK TO HAVING AN ENGAGING NARRATIVE> AND I ASK MYSELF> DOES THIS TECHNOLOGY ACHIEVE THAT FOR ME?

SET UP AS PRACTICAL ASSIGNMENTS USING PRACTICAL TOOLS....EXCEL, GIS, GOOGLE EARTH API, GRACE DATA, PYTHON AND ORANGE ML.

**Core Area 2b Case iii: Digital Textbooks and Multilingual Access: Affordability, Inclusivity, and Cognitive Load**

Differences in technical lexicons, academic assumptions, and prior preparation can limit access even in institutions that pride themselves on inclusion. At the University of Greenwich, I teach a civil and environmental engineering cohort that is overwhelmingly international, multilingual, and often composed of first-generation university students. While conversational fluency in English is common, technical fluency is not. Terms like <em>hydraulic head</em>, <em>shear stress</em>, or <em>Darcy flux</em> are dense even for native speakers. For non-native speakers, they often sit atop an invisible stack of linguistic and conceptual barriers.</p>

To address this, I integrate open-access digital textbooks from the <a href="https://gw-project.org" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #004080;">Groundwater Project</a> into my courses. These are seminal texts authored by international experts and made available in multiple languages, including French, Spanish, Farsi, Portuguese, and Urdu. This allows students to cross-reference difficult concepts in the language they understand best, reducing cognitive load and enabling deeper conceptual understanding.</p>

The texts are freely accessible to read online and downloadable in PDF format, removing the financial burden of purchasing traditional textbooks. I provide links directly through the module’s Moodle site and include specific reading assignments and diagrams in both English and translated formats where available. Lecture materials are adapted to reflect global case studies, using consistent technical terminology aligned with these multilingual resources.</p>

I also design assessments with flexible topic options and multiple technical entry points to support students from varied academic backgrounds. Where appropriate, I schedule teaching around midday prayer and include structured breaks, fostering a learning environment that is inclusive, respectful, and attentive to student wellbeing.</p>
