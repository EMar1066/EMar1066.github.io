### Reflection
Many of our students have never known a world without screens. For some, the first interface wasn’t a book or a toy; it was a touchscreen. A glowing rectangle handed to them in a pram, a high-pitched app voiced by a cartoon, a video that played again, and again, and again. These weren’t neutral tools. From the start, they were built to capture and hold attention and to compete, highly successfully, with toys, conversation, even comfort. The battle for screen time begins early.
