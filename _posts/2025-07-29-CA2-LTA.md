### Reflection
Many of our students have never known a world without screens. For some, the first interface wasn’t a book or a toy—it was a touchscreen, a glowing rectangle handed to them in a pram. A bright and colourful featuring cartoon host with a high-pitched voice. A video that played again, and again, and again. These weren’t neutral tools. From the start, they were designed to hold attention—to compete, successfully, with toys, conversation, even comfort. The battle for screen time begins early. And it is meticulously engineered.

The platforms we give children are not passive. They’re built by behavioural designers and UX teams, optimised for a single metric: time on screen. Infinite scroll, autoplay, push notifications—none of it is incidental. These design choices exploit neurological reward loops, encouraging compulsive use (van Koningsbruggen et al., 2020). Studies link early exposure to changes in the brain, especially in areas governing attention and impulse control (Children and Screens, 2021). These systems weren’t designed to teach. They were built to retain. I’ve come to see this as a key distinction when choosing tools for university learning: understanding how students’ attention has been shaped [K3], and using that awareness to make pedagogical decisions informed by both research and experience [V3].

Digital media didn’t just enter childhood. It colonised it. Every platform, every app, every algorithm is built on the same logic we traced earlier: broadcast, dressed as interactivity. But the loop is closed—engineered for stickiness, not understanding. What matters isn’t what you learn, but how long you stay. Just like junk food: brightly packaged, instantly gratifying, difficult to resist.

We’ve seen this before. Over the past century, food products were engineered not for nourishment, but appeal. The “bliss point”—a calibrated mix of sugar, salt, and fat—activates reward systems and encourages repeat consumption. As Moss (2013) writes in Salt Sugar Fat, the goal was never nutrition. It was engagement.

These weren’t meals. They were edible interfaces—engineered to create habits. Over time, they reshaped not just the palate, but the expectation of food itself. Something wholesome might be better for you, but it wouldn’t “taste like anything.” Something meaningful might deserve your time, but it wouldn’t “hold you.”

A darker analogy lies in slot machines. Endless scroll, variable  rewards, instant feedback—platforms now borrow directly from the  heavily engineered behavioural logic of gambling. As Schüll (2012) documents in Addiction  by Design, casino systems weren’t built to excite, but to entrance. To  induce “the zone,” a trance of uninterrupted use. The goal isn’t joy.  Its continuity. 

The same logic now underpins digital media. Short loops. Bright visuals. Predictable payoffs. TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat—apps designed to train, not teach. You don’t have to like the content. You just have to keep scrolling.

It’s no accident we employ the word “users.” The word fits.

That same logic now underpins dashboards, polling  apps, push notifications. In using these delivery methods we are no longer teaching attention—we’re reconstructing the systems that dismantled it. It has reshaped how I think about attention.  The metrics behind it are behavioural, not cognitive: scroll depth, bounce rate, time to exit. And it’s not just youth. Anyone habituated within these systems carries that logic forward (Zuboff, 2019).

Educational software often patterns itself  after platform logic—we’re teaching inside it. Students may become fluent in engagement, but it’s behavioural, not reflective. They expect learning to feel like swiping. They expect the dopamine.  The platforms train students to expect novelty. The ed-tech industry knows this. 

Promoting engagement might make some sense in compulsory education. But at university, the contract changes. Adults bring their own engagement. That’s the pedagogical potluck. Students raised on platforms don’t arrive empty-headed—they arrive trained by their environments. Their habits, expectations, and sense of what “learning” feels like have been shaped—quietly, systematically—by technologies designed by platforms focused not on growth or education, but on user retention.
