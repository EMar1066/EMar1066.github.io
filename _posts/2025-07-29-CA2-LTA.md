## Preface


The following section outlines my university-level teaching experience, developed across academic posts in both Canada and the UK. This includes my current role as Lecturer and MSc Programme Leader in Civil Engineering at University of Greenwich (2022-present), previous experience as a Teaching Fellow at University of Birmingham (2021-2022), and earlier experience as a Term Adjunct Lecturer at Queen’s University at Kingston (2017-2019). I have taught at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, led curriculum redevelopment, and supervised MSc research in the UK. These experiences have reinforced the importance of structured, context-rich teaching that supports technical learning and the  adoption of technology, as well as decision making, communication, and interdisciplinary engagement within engineering education

## Core Area 2a: Teaching Experience and Curriculum Development

At Queen’s, large lectures in civil engineering drew from outdated templates and static PDFs. With limited digital infrastructure and no institutional push toward TEL integration, I relied heavily on smartboard logic and partial note handouts. Students responded strongly to this low-tech approach—not because it was novel, but because it created space for pacing, reasoning, and co-construction of knowledge. This reinforced for me that clarity and structure matter more than polish—particularly in high-cognitive-load topics like hydrology, contaminant transport, numerical methods and fluid mechanics.

At Birmingham, the shift to hybrid delivery follwoing the pandemic prompted a deeper engagement with online tools. I implemented Panopto lecture capture, but resisted overuse of polling tools, having seen engagement fatigue surface early. In one module, I redesigned the assessment brief to simulate a real-world technical report with constraints drawn from client briefs which integrate both civil engineering judgement and communication clarity. Feedback from students highlighted how much they valued authenticity and pacing over digital flair.

***Core Area 2a Case i: Current Role and Technolgical Integration***

In my current role I lead MSc Water, Waste & Environmental Engineering programme and I have  have redeveloped and led two Level-7 modules in the Civil Engineering programme: Contaminant Hydrogeology and Remediation (ENVI1195) and Hydrosystems Engineering and Management (CIVI1135).  I have also co-taught BEng modules including Introduction to Solid and Fluid Mechanics (GEEN1193) and Environment and Earth Materials (CIVI1158). Additionally, I have supervised MSc dissertation projects within the programme, which have uniquely focused on data driven engineering analyses using the tools most appropriate to both objectives and student capabilities.

My teaching approach now balances scaffolded interactivity with cognitive stretch. My use of technology in teaching is thoughfully applied to focus the students on the interacations occuring in the classroom, or to extend their abilities to facilitate applied problem solving.  When tools like Mentimeter and Moodle quizzes are used, they serve as entry points. More often, I use partial notes, interactive applets, and structured smartboard walkthroughs to build conceptual fluency. This hybrid method is grounded in constructivist pedagogy, but also shaped by my learners’ realities: varied levels of digital fluency, uneven preparedness, and often, especially in engineering contexts, a desire for practical relevance over abstraction.

The feedback for this method has been highly positive, as my line manager and Dupty Head of School reported that:

> (Evidence) "Eric has received excellent student evaluations in two of his modules that he leads..."He has demonstrated a strong commitment to teaching excellence. His module shells have been completed to a high standard."

While students have provided encouraging feedback on my technologically integrated appraoch as well:

> The real-time data on the hydraulics of Prof. is perfect

> (Evidence) "Loved the teaching methodology of Dr Eric Martin will hope to learn more from him in future and work under his supervision to deepen and enhance my knowledge."

> (Evidence) "The Lecturer consistently fosters an inclusive environment and goes above and beyond to ensure we have a strong understanding of the module."

> (Evidence) "Dr Eric Martin has been a fantastic lecturer this term. It is a shame he will only be leading part of the course."

And with respect to an assignment that required MSc students to develop an analytica stochastic model for contaminant transport (ENVI-1195)

> (Evidence) "The model fosters critical thinking, and the examples the professor provides helped bridge the gap between what I’m reading and what to expect in industry"

My aim is to reflect the evolving demands and technical capabilites of engineering education, shaped by both my background in civil and environmental engineering and my earlier academic grounding in literature and narrative. I often structure lectures using frame narratives—embedding technical material within a contextual arc, a real-world scenario, or a slowly unfolding problem. This approach has proven especially effective in environmental engineering and hydrogeology, where systems are non-linear, consequences are distributed across time and space, and student intuition often needs scaffolding to grapple with delayed causality or layered complexity.

***Core Area 2a Case ii: End-Point Assessor, Digital and Technology Solutions, BSc Hons (Degree Apprenticeship), Ford Pro***

In addition to the modules I lead, I contribute to our school’s delivery of the <a href="https://www.gre.ac.uk/undergraduate-courses/engsci/digital_technology_solutions_bsc_hons_degree_apprenticeship" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Digital and Technology Solutions, BSc Hons (Degree Apprenticeship)</a> as an End-Point Assessor. The programme, accredited by Tech Industry Gold, combines academic study with workplace-based learning and is tailored to meet the evolving demands of the digital sector.

My recent assessment work focused on learners from Ford Pro, whose digital teams develop technology tools for managing commercial vehicle fleets. Projects included frontend development of dashboards relaying API-fed lead and sales data to regional representatives, as well as backend systems focused on regression testing and network integrity. These applied solutions aligned surprisingly well with my own teaching experiences in modelling and data interpretation, though the professional contexts were markedly different.

What struck me most was the shared objective: whether in environmental engineering or fleet analytics, the core challenge remains how to increase engagement and deliver information meaningfully within complex systems. I provided feedback on code logic, system architecture, remote presentation skills, and the structure of technical slide decks. I also encouraged learners to reflect on future extensions of their work, particularly around deployment, automation, and user interaction.

This experience reinforces the value of authentic, outcome-based assessment in professional education. It has informed my broader teaching by highlighting how technical competence, communication, and applied reasoning converge in real-world settings.

***Core Area 2a Reflections***

When I started teaching as a graduate student, there weren’t many tools. I began with pacing and with whiteboards and felt tips that ran out mid-equation. That was a good thing, I think. I’m fortunate to remember what it’s like to hold a room without help, with only a stick of chalk to protect myself with from the anticipting eyes. Later, when I began leading modules, technology in the classroom was accelerating—but I already had developed a style. I bent the tools to fit it, not the other way around. In lectures, I use well-designed, annotated visuals to pull the class into the material—to give context, to show why it matters. Lecture recordings and walkthroughs help students who can’t attend in person, and assignment briefs, datasets, and practicum tasks are always available. Interactive tools like the Jupyter notebooks discussed in Core Area 1 have deepened my ability to model real-world behaviours. They give students not just a formula, but a sense of why it behaves that way, and how that behaviour plays out in realistic scenarios.

I am a student of technology. As it evolves, we all are. I’ve learned how to use new tools as they emerge, and I’ve tried to keep my focus on what they’re for—rather than what they seem to offer. One of the risks I’ve come to recognise is the slide into passive delivery. I think about how radio didn’t start out as a broadcast medium; in its early days, it was only HAM radio operators: conversational, participatory, even chaotic (Blake, 1926; ARRL, 2024). As Douglas (1999) observes, early radio created a sense of direct connection—listeners felt as though the medium was speaking just to them. That intimacy was real, but it became one-directional, much like Television. The same observatrion can be made with regard to the early internet. Web 1.0 was exploratory, decentralised—something you wandered through, but it eventually gave way to social media platforms, which are laregely passive, with intermittant bursts of minimal engagement, measured in scrolls and clicks, which has been written about extensively by van Dijck (2013) and Srnicek (2017). In my teaching, I want it to resemble HAM radio, or a BBS server, at least on an emotional level, and I have used all the tools in my power to advance that goal.   Based on the student feedback, using tehcnological tools to comlpliment design appears to be successful. I'm acutely aware that tools alone don’t build engagement. That still requires structure, attention, and shared focus—something I try to cultivate using every tool available, not to distract from the subject, but to bond over.

The perspective of being a perpetual student of technology permeated my role as End Point Assessor for the Digital Technology Solutions degree apprenticeship. I  genuinely enjoyed it. These were professionals working on API-fed dashboards to track sales leads, or back-end regression testing to reduce lag and data loss—serious issues in their business context. What struck me was how closely their aims mirrored what I try to teach: clarity, responsiveness, and meaningful communication through code. Watching them work, I saw familiar principles applied in unfamiliar ways. It was refreshing to step outside the academic frame and see those ideas play out in a different register—less about models, more about consequences. I felt bonded to these young engineers and their mentors—not through the tools themselves, but through the problems they were trying to solve. That’s what I try to cultivate in my own teaching as well: not distraction from the subject, but connection around it.

## Core Area 2b Understanding my target learners

***Core Area 2b Case i: The Simplicity of a Smartboard***

Understanding my students is central to developing a rapport and sense of connection with them.  I've also been in their shoes, and know what understading they will need to have achieved on graduation day and what it takes to achieve that. The steps. As a PhD candidate, I watched my mentor begin each lecture with handwritten skeletons of ideas—headings on acetate. The class was provided with photocopies of those acetates, filled with only headings, nothing more. The rest unfolded as he delivered the lecture, paced slowly and pausing frequenctly to clairfy questions that came up.  He advised me that “There’s value in putting pen to paper,” and that “People remember what they write in their own hand. They ask questions the moment they stop following. If they have full notes in front of them, they will mentally disengage at the first inevitaable roadblock with a false feeling of secruity the notes give them.”

His approach stayed with me and its a tecnique I've adopted and adapted to the wondeful advnaces that have been made since.  I use a hybrid structure that uses tablets or smarboards, partial notes, deliberate pacing designed to present content as well as engaging students in constructing
their own instance of it interally. I later found that Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014) and Van der Meer & Van der Weel (2017) show that the act of handwriting and diagramming activates neural pathways that support understanding, and its made even more powerful with the abilty to show diagrams, videos, launch Jupyter notebooks or GIS viewers as supplments, mid stream.  Platforms like moodle allow text readings to be available in advance for the most studious, and fully completed notes are posted, along with video recordings of the lecture after class, enchaning the accessiblity of the lecture.  The lecture turns into an event, which draws the student's attention, and we progress through discussions and matehematical derivations together. 

One student emailed me after term end to say my lecture 

> (Evidence) “...somehow feels exactly how my brain wants to receive it.”

That feedback supports my belief that structured pacing has real value. It is not about minimising technology, but about using it to create the right conditions for engagement. I suspect the student felt this way because the lecture allowed for moments of difficulty and recovery, guided by a clear logical progression, and supported rather than replaced by the tools used.

Having been born in 1979, I’m acutely aware that most students in today’s classrooms have never known a world without screens. Mobile apps are optimised for a single metric—time on screen—and early exposure has been linked to changes in attention and impulse control (Children and Screens, 2021). Firth et al. (2019) argue that sustained digital engagement can recondition cognitive habits, weakening working memory, reducing attentional control, and increasing the cost of switching between tasks. Recent studies show that undergraduates who frequently consume short-form video have significantly reduced attention spans, though carefully structured teaching can help mitigate this effect (Haliti‑Sylaj & Sadiku, 2024). Experimental work also indicates that TikTok-style feeds interfere directly with memory retention and task intention (Chiossi et al., 2023). Drody (2025) suggests that sustaining attention depends not only on reducing distraction but on fostering task value and deliberate pacing. These findings reinforce why my use of technology is not about filling time, but about scaffolding attention, slowing delivery, and giving space for nuance to emerge.

My teaching responds to this generational shift. I don’t aim to outrun distraction—I aim to out-structure it. That framing, I think, is part of why the approach resonates. The students have responded well:

> (Evidence) "I have found the fluids presentations well constructed and interesting - the lecturer has obviously made a lot of effort to make the subject interesting and even fun. I also liked the fluids tutorial questions which were pitched at the right level for me."

> (Evidence) "One of the lecturers actually gave us worksheets to work through in the tutorial which helped with the understanding and went around to each person answering questions and checking the work"

The result was a redeveloped class that was significantly more demanding and students who perfomred far more difficult operations than previous iterations.  It was technically richer and conceptually deeper but there was no drop in average performance. Students were not overwhelmed. They were supported by teaching strategies chosen deliberately, and by technological tools that made those strategies possible.

REWRITE 

IT FELT THAT WAY BECAUSE IT WANS KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY DISCOVERED AND WORKED THROUGH THEMSELVES....GUIDED MY MY LECTURE AND LINE BY LINE PROGRESSIONS. ANY ASPECTS THAT CAUSE CONFUSION IMMEIDDATLEY PROVOKE QUESTIONS

THE METHOD STOPS IS FROM BEING ONE WAY COMMUNICATION, THE WAY THAT RADIO WENT.  WE ARE ALL PRESENT SYNHRONOUSLY...WE ARE IN THE SAME ROOM. THESE THINGS DO MATTER 

MY TEACHING PROCESSES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED SINCE 2017 TO REFLECT MY UNDERSTANDING OF TSUDENTS AND WHAT THEY WANT.   EVERY STUDENT WANTS GOOD GRADES AND FOR ASSIGNMENTS TO BE EASY TO APPROACH, BUT ULITMATELY THAT IS HOLLOW. WHAT THEY REMEMBER, AND WHAT STAYS WITH THEM IS OVERCOMING ADVERSITY...ITS LIKE SOMEONE GIVING YOU CANDY VS. WINNING THE BIG GAME AFTER TRAINING.  RATHTE RHTAN HANDING OUT CANDY, i HAVE ASPIRED TO BE THE COACH THTAT SHOWS THEM WHAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF, GIVEN A FOUNDATION OF THEORY AND THE RIGHT TOOLS.

***Core Area 2b Case ii: Large-Scale Gamification***

I use large-scale roleplay as a pedagogical framework, structuring assignments around realistic engineering tasks rather than isolated quizzes or polls. Students work in defined roles—consulting engineers, regulators, site assessors—and complete sequences of applied tasks that reflect real-world conditions.

These assignments use publicly available datasets and domain-specific tools: GIS platforms, Google Earth overlays, the BGS Geology Viewer, the BGS Wellbore Repository, and groundwater data from <a href="https://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">  NASA’s GRACE data via the Giovanni portal</a> and the <a href="https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Earthdata API</a>. Tutorials guide students through tasks such as risk assessment, data interpretation, intervention planning, and professional reporting. Each stage builds on the last, simulating the workflow of practicing engineers.

This method supports both engagement and transferability, grounding abstract concepts in applied decision-making scenarios. Students commented: 

> (Evidence) "The tutorial after each lecturer really helps to understand what is the purpose of what is being taught"

> (Evidence) The professor (even though new to the university) brings in his experiences in the field while teaching. This helped me know the real
life applications and scenarios.

> (Evidence) "The model fosters critical thinking, and the examples the professor provides helped bridge the gap between what I’m reading and what to expect in industry"

That purpose, for me, is always clarity through narrative, supported by tools that deepen rather than distract.Tutorials were structured as a progressive sequence of engineering tasks, guiding students through applied problem-solving using the tools introduced in each session. The aim was to help students picture themselves working as engineers—not just learning the material, but applying it.

Games engage us. Until they don’t. Novelty fades. Longitudinal studies (Domínguez et al., 2013) show that early enthusiasm for gamified systems often gives way to reduced motivation and deeper disengagement. I’ve seen this in my own teaching: by mid-semester, responses to Mentimeter polls drop off. Written inputs become sparse, or worse, ironic or disruptive. 

A growing body of literature warns that gamification, when misused or overused, can have adverse effects. Almeida et al. (2023) identified 87 studies reporting negative outcomes, including motivational decline and cheating. Tomé Klock et al. (2023) raise ethical concerns around voluntariness and cognitive manipulation. Mogavi et al. (2022)  describe a case in which learners became more focused on maintaining game mechanics than on making substantive progress—an example of how rewards can steer attention away from actual learning. Even earlier  studies, such as Hanus & Fox (2015) and Iten & Petko (2016),  showed gamified learning environments could reduce motivation and  performance when rewards were poorly aligned with cognitive goals. These  findings challenge the assumption that interactivity is inherently  beneficial and call into question whether our tools are fostering  reflection or simply simulating it.

I began to reframe how I use engagement tools. Less as a measure of participation; more as a prompt for explanation or discussion. The goal was not activity. It was attention [K3; A4].

This shift pushed me to reflect on my own education. I realised that many of my most formative experiences weren’t gamified, but role-based. We were treated as engineers. Assignments required us to act as professionals: Analysing data, writing reports, making technical recommendations under realistic constraints. It was a combination of an assessment, and from our side a performance, it gave us frame within we coudl apply ourselves.

I first brought that model into my own teaching while leading a Professional Skills and Ethics course at Queen’s University. Grounded in <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90p28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Professional Engineers Act (R.R.O. 1990)</a>, the course invited students to analyse real misconduct cases, evaluate risks, and write formal communications as if they were practising engineers. Since then, I’ve used similar framing in technical courses. Students draw on real site data from the BGS Geology Viewer, the BGS Wellbore Repository, the NASA GRACE project API, and GIS overlays in Google Earth. These aren’t just datasets, they also serve as props and scenery: Narrative elements. Students work as if embedded in real projects, with real decisions to make and real consequences to weigh.

Some classroom tools capture attention, but in my course design, I intend to also build it. Gamification, if shallow, tends to fade. But immersion, the kind you find in world-rich games like <a href="https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Elder Scrolls</a> or the tabletop logic of <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoriSzUChY6CVNgr4DMxFZu82m1I6YaH04Br2TzQKMHAmeXAuD1x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Dungeons & Dragons </a> relies on structure, depth, and buy-in. That’s the model I follow now, as the dungeeon master.

***Core Area 2b Case iii: Digital Textbooks and Multilingual Access: Affordability, Inclusivity, and Cognitive Load***

Differences in technical lexicons, academic assumptions, and prior preparation can limit access even in institutions that pride themselves on inclusion. At the University of Greenwich, I teach a civil and environmental engineering cohort that is overwhelmingly international, multilingual, and often composed of first-generation university students. While conversational fluency in English is common, technical fluency is not. Terms like <em>hydraulic head</em>, <em>shear stress</em>, or <em>Darcy flux</em> are dense even for native speakers. For non-native speakers, they often sit atop an invisible stack of linguistic and conceptual barriers.

To address this, I integrate open-access digital textbooks from the <a href="https://gw-project.org" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #004080;">Groundwater Project</a> into my courses. These are seminal texts authored by international experts and made available in multiple languages, including French, Spanish, Farsi, Portuguese, and Urdu. This allows students to cross-reference difficult concepts in the language they understand best, reducing cognitive load and enabling deeper conceptual understanding.

The texts are freely accessible to read online and downloadable in PDF format, removing the financial burden of purchasing traditional textbooks. I provide links directly through the module’s Moodle site and include specific reading assignments and diagrams in both English and translated formats where available. Lecture materials are adapted to reflect global case studies, using consistent technical terminology aligned with these multilingual resources.

I also design assessments with flexible topic options and multiple technical entry points to support students from varied academic backgrounds. Where appropriate, I schedule teaching around midday prayer and include structured breaks, fostering a learning environment that is inclusive, respectful, and attentive to student wellbeing.
