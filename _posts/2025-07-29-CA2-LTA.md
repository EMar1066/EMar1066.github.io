## Preface

**Core Area 2a) Understanding of teaching, learning and/or assessment processes**

**External Examiner Role for DTS**


**The Simplicity of a Smartboard**
 In my lectures, I give students partial notes: a scaffold, not a script. Enough to follow, not enough to coast. I’ve found this helps students focus on core reasoning steps without getting lost in transcription—a method I’ve adopted to support active cognitive engagement, especially in concept-heavy sessions. It’s not just about delivery; it’s about designing material that invites participation without overstimulation. The aim is simple: to help students build understanding through their own written logic, not mine.  Fully notatated slides are uploaded after each class, along wiht a Panopto reording of the seseion to encourage in-person attendance in lectures, which has been shown to XXXXXX

This method was modelled for me during my education in Canada, where doctoral programmes are 5-7 years in length and operate under an apprenticehsip mode. As a PhD candidate, I watched my supervisor begin each lecture with handwritten skeletons of ideas—headings on acetate, nothing more. The rest unfolded in real time. “There’s value in putting pen to paper,” he told me. “People remember what they write in their own hand. They ask questions the moment they stop following.   If they have full notes in front of them, they will mentally disengage at the first inevitaable roadblock with a false feeling of secruity the notes give them.”  What he was doing wasn’t performative, but rather structural. A personal conversation scaled up to the capacity room.

That approach stayed with me. In my first lecture as an adjunct, chemistry, in front of 200 undergraduate engineers in 2017, I imitated him. Over time, I made it mine. I now use a hybrid structure: whiteboard logic, partial notes, deliberate pacing that was designed not just to present content, but to engage students in constructing it actively. It’s not flashy, but it works. Students aren’t just watching me, they’re actively building the argument line by line, with me, in real time.

One student emailed me after term end to say my lecture “somehow feels exactly how my brain wants to receive it.” They felt motivated to explore further. That feedback, and others like it, have reinforced the value of intentional structure. Not tools for their own sake, but design choices that foster space, focus, and trust in their own abilities and comprehension. Attention, developed through practice rather than simply and momentarily captured.

***Core Area 2a) Case 1***

***Programme Lead Water, Waste and Environmental Engineering (MSc)***

My teaching includes both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, and I have redeeveloped MSc level modules in contaminant hydrogeology and hydrosystems engineering and man-
agement. I previously lectured in Numerical Methods, Chemistry and Professional Skills for Civil Engineers at Queen’s, and later taught hydrogeology and water resources at University
of Birmingham. My teaching approach is structured and inclusive, combining scaffolded tutorial support with assessment formats that accommodate diverse academic backgrounds.
I also serve as an external assessor for Taighde Éireann (Research Ireland) and for the Ford Pro digital apprenticeship programme in software engineering.

I have developed, revised and dlivered numerous classes, including Numerical Methods for Civil Engineers, Chemistry for Civil Engineering, professional Skills



### Reflection
The right tool is the one that sharpens thought. And sometimes the most radical instrument is also the oldest: the pen. Handwriting, as Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014) and Van der Meer & Van der Weel (2017) show, activates neural pathways that support understanding—not just transcription

### Evidence
#### Contaminant Hydrogeology and Groundwater Remediation
> "The coursework was interesting as the integration of real life scenario in the coursework was good for learning."

> "The Lecturer consistently fosters an inclusive environment and goes above and beyond to ensure we have a strong understanding of
the module."

> "The model fosters critical thinking, and the examples the professor provides helped bridge the gap between what I’m reading and what
to expect in industry"

#### Hydrosystems Engineering and Managment (MSc)
> "Loved the teaching methodology of Dr Eric Martin will hope to learn more from him in future and work under his supervision to deepen
and enhance more knowledge."

#### Environment and Earth Materials (BSc)
>"The tutorial after each lecturer really helps to understand what is the purpose of what is being taught"

## b) Understanding my target learners
**The Power of Simplicity: Whiteboard Use and Cognitive Development in HE**

I see learning is an active process in his approach of engaging in fundamental theory and the application of that theory to eventually create original knowledge.   The use of technology in the classroom can manifest at many different depths, and  my approach to teaching focuses on encouraging active engagement and critique of the material that is being presented. 
This is a case where the simplest of technologies has proven to be one of the most effective.

> "The professor (even though new to the university) brings in his experiences in the field while teaching. This helped me know the real
life applications and scenarios"

#### Hydrosystems Engineering and Managment (MSc)
>"I really enjoyed this course, and I can imagine how challenging it was to design and balance both the engineering and management
aspects of it, but the way it was delivered not only made the content engaging but it also encouraged a lot of critical thinking on my
part, which I really appreciated"

#### Environment and Earth Materials (BSc)
>"Dr Eric Martin has been a fantastic lecturer this term. It is a shame he will only be leading part of the course."

>"The tutorial after each lecturer really helps to understand what is the purpose of what is being taught"

#### Introduction to Solid and Fluid Mechanics
> "I stepped into fluid mechanics lectures expected to struggle a lot, however Eric made it seem
simple. His lectures were nice and short, yet very informative. The tutorial part of the lectures was enjoyable with both professors.
They were both willing to help out personally for each question, which was unexpected as other module professors don’t do it like that.
It gave me and other students and sense of care, which is very needed for a students benefits"

> "One of the lecturers actually gave us worksheets to work through in the tutorial which helped with the understanding and went around
to each person answering questions and checking the work"

> "I have found the fluids presentations well constructed and interesting - the lecturer has obviously made a lot of effort to make the
subject interesting and even fun. I also liked the fluids tutorial questions which were pitched at the right level for me."

> "St George's Centre does not allow for lecture recordings and the WiFi is not reliable, which means that attendance sometimes has to
be taken using paper. It is also very cold. It was not made for a lecture environment where one is sitting there for 3 hours (always have
felt compelled to put the coat back on because of this)."
