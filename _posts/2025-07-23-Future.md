<em>“A university training is the great ordinary means to a great but ordinary end; it aims at raising the intellectual tone of society… It is the education which gives a man a clear conscious view of his own opinions and judgments, a truth in developing them, an eloquence in expressing them, and a force in urging them.”</em>

Future research will build on my current work integrating multiphase subsurface hydrogeology with machine learning, image analysis, and environmental data science to address emerging challenges in water, energy, and geoscience systems. Specific topics in the near term include: a) machine learning and imaging approaches to improve subsurface characterisation across applications such as carbon storage, nuclear waste containment, and groundwater systems; b) remote hydro-geoinformatics for groundwater assessment and environmental monitoring in data-scarce and climate-sensitive regions; and c) experimental and image-guided characterisation of nanobubbles for application in environmental and engineered systems.
