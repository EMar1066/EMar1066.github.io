<em>“A university training is the great ordinary means to a great but ordinary end; it aims at raising the intellectual tone of society… It is the education which gives a man a clear conscious view of his own opinions and judgments, a truth in developing them, an eloquence in expressing them, and a force in urging them.”</em>

## Future Plans (2025/2026)

I’ve seen classroom technology evolve from acetate to live-coded simulations, from overhead projectors to AI-powered dashboards. Not every shift has been wise, but the trajectory has been powerful. What matters now isn’t speed but it's intent. With careful design, the right tools still have the power to deepen understanding rather than distract from it.

In the year ahead, I will lead a national research sprint with The Alan Turing Institute, focused on satellite image segmentation for oil spill detection. This project combines environmental science, machine learning, and explainable modelling, and marks a shift in my role, from facilitating tools to framing problems.

In addition to this, I’m integrating more interactive digital elements into both my existing and newly assigned MSc modules. These aren’t cosmetic changes. They respond to what I’ve seen in practice: that scaffolding, iteration, and well-pitched technical challenges support thinking in ways polling apps never will. As Programme Lead, I’ve already redesigned modules to include MATLAB for problem analysis that had previously relied on rote calculations. Tools matter, but so does how we use them.

This is my first year as a UK academic. I’m now developing MSc and PhD projects that bridge environmental engineering and data science, with collaborations forming across research centres and industry. The aim is to equip students with technical fluency, critical judgement, and the ability to apply both in real-world systems where the consequences matter.

In my graduate student mentorship, I will continue research that integrates multiphase hydrogeology with image analysis and machine learning. Current directions include:

* Improved subsurface characterisation for carbon storage, nuclear containment, and groundwater resilience

* Remote hydro-geoinformatics for environmental monitoring in data-scarce, climate-sensitive regions

* Experimental and image-based investigation of nanobubbles for environmental and engineered systems

## Future Plans (2026–2028)

The pace of change in educational technology over the past three years has been extraordinary. Generative AI, adaptive platforms, large-scale automation: Tools once peripheral are now embedded, often without time to ask whether they serve learning or just simulate it. The coming years will bring more: some promising, some performative, most difficult to predict. But that’s what makes this an exciting time to teach. We are in a position to choose carefully, to adopt only what expands access, sharpens thinking, or builds clarity for students who need it most.

While the future remains uncertain, some principles are not. Adaptability will be essential, but so will discipline. My goal over the next three years is to build a curriculum and research environment that connects technical skill to intellectual agency. Students shouldn’t just run models, they should question assumptions, trace uncertainty, and defend their decisions. That begins in the classroom, but extends to the systems we use, the problems we pose, and the tools we permit.

As Programme Lead for MSc Water, Waste and Environmental Engineering, I now have scope to reshape module content, structure, and pedagogy. My focus is on embedding real tools in real contexts, using datasets with illustrative consequences. This includes developing cross-cutting modules in modelling, data, and environmental systems, and formalising joint supervision across departments to support interdisciplinary research.

I also intend to keep pressing for a more critical stance on educational technology. Which I've begun to address in though-piece writing, which I intend to continue and develop. It’s how easily convenience becomes the default. My role is to ensure tools are used with intent, not inertia. Sometimes that means technical integration. Sometimes it also means knowing when the simplest medium is the best choice for education.

In the years ahead, I want to continue refining a curriculum that supports clarity, structure, and independent reasoning. The role of technology in that process is practical: to scaffold complexity, test understanding, and open space for better thinking. When chosen carefully, the right tools help students form and communicate their ideas with greater precision. That remains the core aim: Technology not as spectacle, but as support for the kind of learning a university should make possible.
