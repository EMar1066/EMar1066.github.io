I am an Applied Hydrogeological Engineer with over fifteen years of experience spanning academia, environmental regulation, and field-based systems. My doctoral research at Queen’s University focused on interpreting time-series thermal and electrical feedback data as applied to subsurface remediation, for physical and thermal analysis. This work demanded modelling and simulation, environmental signal processing, and the quantification and assessment of uncertainty. My experience in data-driven engineering now underpins how I teach and supervise: from numerical and analytical simulation to machine learning analysis of porous media flow systems. In my practice, hydrogeology is not to be confused with geology. It is environmental computation, and I feel entirely at home using and teaching with technology.

Following my PhD, I taught at Queen’s University, where I introduced sensor interpretation and subsurface modelling into my early teaching practice. I later held a one-year academic post at the University of Birmingham, and currently hold a faculty position at the University of Greenwich. My teaching includes water resources, hydrosystems, and environmental engineering. Modules I have led include fluid mechanics, time-series analysis, contaminant hydrogeology, and hydrological modelling. I supervise MSc projects in contaminant transport, image-based analysis, and machine learning for environmental data. These projects are grounded in engineering logic and make use of digital tools for both delivery and analysis.

Since joining the University of Greenwich in Spring 2024, I inherited several legacy modules that had become static and overcrowded. I rebuilt them from first principles, introducing design-based assignments, interactive teaching, and technical scaffolds that enabled students to work at greater analytical depth. These were not superficial enhancements, but deliberate changes to deepen engagement with theory and expand what students could accomplish. Performance held steady as complexity increased. Students responded to the structured challenge. In Spring 2025, I was appointed Programme Leader for the MSc Civil Engineering (Water, Waste and Environmental Engineering).

In addition to my university teaching, I have worked with The Alan Turing Institute over the past year as Project Facilitator for two national Data Study Group sprints focused on environmental challenges. The DSG is the Institute’s flagship educational programme, designed to train the next generation of data scientists through collaborative, real-world problem solving. These are intensive, short-cycle learning sprints in which PhD and postdoctoral researchers work across disciplinary boundaries to address live partner challenges. My role involved structuring workflows, facilitating interdisciplinary learning, and supporting technical problem-solving under time constraints. It was a hands-on leadership position within a fast-paced, high-trust educational environment.

In 2025, I was appointed Principal Investigator for the autumn Turing Data Study Group. My role extends across the full educational and research cycle: framing the problem, securing ethics clearance, designing workflows, directing technical scope, and supporting the production of actionable outputs. The project focuses on detecting oil leaks from shipwrecks using sequential SAR image analysis, and is delivered in collaboration with the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas). It launches in September, with final reporting to the Turing Institute in early 2026. The challenge reflects the scale and direction of my current work in technology-enhanced learning.

My approach to teaching and technology emphasises pragmatism and how chosen tools serve pedagogical goals. I have taught in classrooms with chalkboards and acetates, and over the years have modernised my approach while preserving the elements that proved most impactful. I aim to equip students with tools that allow them to engage more deeply with theory, whether delivered in class or developed through thesis work. With the right scaffolding, they can now achieve far more than would have been possible a decade ago. As platforms change, I adapt. From VLE transitions to shifts in format and delivery, the tools I use follow the problem specification. That, I believe, is good engineering. I select technologies that help students understand structure, test their logic, and solve problems that would be out of reach by hand.

***Why CMALT***

I am applying for CMALT because it provides a widely recognised framework to reflect on, document, and improve the work I already do. My teaching, supervision, and curriculum design all rely on digital tools—coding environments, modelling software, delivery technologies, VLEs, and asynchronous platforms. I am mindful not to use these tools as accessories or novelties, but as integrated parts of how I structure learning. Being part of CMALT offers the opportunity to examine that practice critically, refine it further, and to become part of a network of people facing similar challenges.

CMALT accreditation offers a structured way to examine my teaching more systematically. It helps me document key decisions, revisit assumptions, and build on what has worked. I value that the process is grounded in practice rather than job titles. While I do not hold a post in learning technology, much of my teaching depends on it.

This portfolio, as it should be, is a work in progress. Some sections are linked to ongoing projects, and others will be added as future work develops. For me, CMALT is not a box to tick, but a framework for continued improvement. The ALT community reflects the direction I aim to grow as an educator and researcher working with technology, and I would value the opportunity to contribute to and learn from it.
