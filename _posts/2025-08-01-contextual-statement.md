I grew up in Canada, where the snow is deep and the winters long and my path to an academic career was anything but direct. In previous professional lives, I’ve been an English major, a senior writer and editor of a university newspaper, a Chemical Engineer, a graduate researcher, an environmental scientist in the high Arctic, a subject matter expert and Provincial Officer with the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, and an adjunct lecturer at Queen’s University and the University of Birmingham.

I’ve embraced technology in teaching from my beginnings. From acetate overheads to virtual whiteboards and live-coded simulations, I’ve seen tools change—but not always improve—the way we teach. My approach has never been driven by novelty, but by what the tools enable. And because I’ve had the benefit of hindsight—of mentors who built courses with pen and paper, chalk and patience—I’ve been able to extend their work in new directions.
