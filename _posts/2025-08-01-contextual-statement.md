I grew up in Canada, where the snow is deep and the winters long and my path to an academic career was anything but direct. In previous professional lives, I’ve been an English major, a senior writer and editor of a university newspaper, a Chemical Engineer, a graduate researcher, an environmental scientist in the high Arctic, a subject matter expert and Provincial Officer with the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, and an adjunct lecturer at Queen’s University and the University of Birmingham.

I’ve embraced technology in teaching from my beginnings. I was six when I first laid my fingers across the keyboard of a classroom Apple IIe. The impact was immediate and permanent. It wasn’t just the novelty.  It was possibility, agency, scale. That moment shaped how I saw learning from then on. It marked a shift, not just for me, but from the kind of education my parents had received, into a world becoming vastly different than theirs.  

From bark and slate to paper, fountain pens, calculators, and smartboards: Each step carried promise: to extend what we can do, to make thinking visible, to offload the routine so we can go deeper and achieve more in the little precious educational time that is available. 

In my own experience, I've seen acetate overheads transition to virtual whiteboards and live-coded simulations. Tools change, although they do not always improve the way we teach, especially when chosen indiscirimately, or employed without foresight. My educational approach to TEL has never been driven by novelty, but by what the tools enable and how it can be used to improve the human skills we possess. And because I’ve had the benefit of hindsight—of mentors who built courses with pen and paper, chalk and patience—I’ve been able to extend their work in new directions.

My academic work focuses on multiphase reactive fluid flows, particularly in applied hydrogeology and subsurface environmental systems. I’ve supervised MSc research on contaminant transport and data-driven modelling, and I’ve collaborated with The Alan Turing Institute on machine learning applications in carbon sequestration and seabed characterisation. In 2024, I joined the University of Greenwich, where I lecture in environmental engineering.

While my current research hinges on the precision of Python syntax and  dry brevity of academic writing, sitting down to reflect on technology in higher provides me with a reward that is perhaps less tangible, but just as real as results flashing across my monitor.  The following portfolio is an addaptaion of a small collection of related reflections written this year articling my progression into fomalised thought regarding TEL. Commiting my epxeriences, thoughts and reflection to paper (even digital paper, in this case) has given me much to  think about and intellectually explore.

I believe complex material deserves clarity, not simplification, and that good teaching stretches attention rather than panders to its limits. That belief runs through this collection: reflections built on reading, shaped by lived teaching experience, informed by student feedback, and written in my own, authentic voice.
