I am an Applied Hydrogeological Engineer with over fifteen years of experience spanning academia, environmental regulation, and field-based systems. My doctoral research at Queen’s University focused on interpreting time-lapse thermal and electrical feedback data during subsurface remediation, which demanded precision in modelling, environmental signal processing, and decision support under uncertainty. That interpretive, data-driven mindset now underpins how I teach and supervise: from numerical simulation to machine learning classification of porous media flow. Hydrogeology, in my practice, is not geology. It is environmental computation.

Following my PhD, I taught at Queen’s University, bringing sensor interpretation and subsurface modelling into early teaching practice. I later held academic posts at the University of Birmingham and now the University of Greenwich. My teaching includes time-series analysis, hydrosystems simulation, environmental classification, and the use of open-source platforms for solving applied problems. I supervise MSc projects in contaminant transport, image-based analysis, and machine learning for environmental data. These projects are grounded in engineering logic and executed through digital tools.

In 2024, I relocated permanently to the UK and joined the University of Greenwich as faculty. Within the year, I was appointed Programme Leader for the MSc Civil Engineering (Water, Waste and Environmental Engineering). I inherited several legacy modules that had become static and overcrowded. I rebuilt them from first principles, introducing design-based assignments, interactive teaching, and technical scaffolds that enabled students to work at greater analytical depth. Tools such as MODFLOW, Python, QGIS, and OrangeML were used not for decoration, but to deepen engagement with theory and extend what students could accomplish. Performance held steady while complexity increased. Students responded to the structured challenge.

Alongside this, I began working with The Alan Turing Institute. I served as Project Facilitator for two national Data Study Group sprints focused on environmental problems. These intensive, team-based research events bring together PhD and postdoctoral researchers to apply data science and machine learning to partner challenges. My role involved structuring workflow, guiding group problem-solving, and maintaining project momentum across disciplines. It was a hands-on leadership role within a fast-moving technical learning environment.

In 2025, I was appointed Principal Investigator for the autumn Turing DSG. I am leading the design and coordination of a national research sprint focused on detecting oil leaks from shipwrecks using sequential SAR image analysis. The project, in collaboration with the British Geological Survey and Cefas, requires full-cycle leadership: from framing the problem and securing ethics clearance to directing research aims and producing actionable outputs. The challenge begins in September, with final reports submitted to the Turing Institute in early 2026. It reflects the scale and trajectory of my current TEL leadership.

My approach to teaching and technology has always been pragmatic. I taught in classrooms with chalkboards and acetates, but marked work through Moodle and ran simulations in MODFLOW, Excel, and MATLAB. As platforms changed, I adapted: from Moodle to D2L to Canvas, from handouts to interactive formats. The tool has always followed the problem. I select technologies that allow students to see structure, test logic, and solve problems that would be out of reach by hand.

***Why CMALT***

I am applying for CMALT because it reflects the way I already teach: deliberately, reflectively, and through structured, tool-supported learning. I do not hold a post in learning technology, but my work depends on it. I build with it, teach through it, and supervise students using it. CMALT offers a language and standard to make that practice visible.

This is not a shift in direction. It is a formal recognition of embedded work. The portfolio includes sections marked in development, aligned with projects that are underway but not yet complete. CMALT provides a frame through which to document, reflect, and continue refining practice within a wider community of educators who take tools seriously—not as trends, but as instruments of thought.
