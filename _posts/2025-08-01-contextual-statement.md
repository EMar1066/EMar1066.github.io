I am an applied hydrogeological engineer with over fifteen years of experience across academia, regulation, and field-based environmental systems. From compliance audits in the Canadian Arctic to MSc supervision using MODFLOW and Python, digital tools have been a structural part of how I teach, model, and reason.

Since transitioning into academia, I’ve taught across undergraduate and postgraduate levels, most recently leading the MSc Civil Engineering (Water, Waste and Environmental Engineering) programme at the University of Greenwich. I teach across undergraduate and postgraduate levels, and currently lead the MSc Civil Engineering (Water, Waste and Environmental Engineering) programme at the University of Greenwich. My approach blends structured delivery with digital scaffolding—supporting students in modelling environmental systems, classifying remote sensing data, and solving applied problems through coding, simulation, and design. I supervise MSc projects in contaminant transport and porous media modelling, increasingly using machine learning for classification and prediction. As Principal Investigator for a national-scale SAR time series project at The Alan Turing Institute, I also lead development of sequential analysis tools for environmental hazard detection. Across these roles, technology is not content—it is method.

Technology is not an add-on in my practice—it underpins how I teach, supervise, and solve problems. I use it when it enables students to reason more clearly, test ideas more thoroughly, or access complexity that manual methods obscure. My approach is shaped by the habits of field regulation and the discipline of teaching—deliberate, structured, and goal-driven.

My relationship with technology began early. I was six when I first laid my fingers on the keyboard of a classroom Apple IIe. The impact was immediate and permanent. My use of technology started early, but its impact became professional in my first classrooms—marking through Moodle, modelling with MODFLOW, delivering sessions through D2L, and later Canvas. The throughline has always been the same: choose tools that serve thinking.

My teaching philosophy begins with context: what are we trying to understand, and what’s the most effective way to get there? Sometimes that’s a whiteboard. Sometimes it’s MODFLOW. Sometimes it’s Python. The tool follows the thinking, and are used to amplify what I wish to convey to my audeince.

I am not a learning technologist by title. I am an engineer, the intersection where science meets technology. For nearly two decades, learning technology has been how I’ve delivered clarity, structure, and challenge—on blackboards, in MODFLOW simulations, through Python scripts, and into classrooms that now expect interactivity on-demand. I haven’t followed trends. I’ve built practice. 

**Why CMALT?**

I am applying for CMALT because its framework mirrors how I already work: reflective, evidence-informed, and grounded in purposeful use of technology to support learning. My practice sits at the intersection of engineering and education, where clarity of thought and tool selection are inseparable.

For nearly two decades, I have used digital tools to design environmental models, build student reasoning, and structure learning that holds up under complexity. CMALT provides a formal way to reflect on that work, benchmark it against national standards, and contribute to a professional community engaged in improving how we teach with technology.

This is not a shift in direction — it is a continuation. My submission aligns with the CMALT principles of reflective practice, operational insight, and inclusive engagement with technology in education. It consolidates work already done and opens the door to deeper collaboration across disciplines and sectors.
