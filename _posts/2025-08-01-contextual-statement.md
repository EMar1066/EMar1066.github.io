I am an applied hydrogeological engineer with over fifteen years of academic, regulatory, and technical experience in subsurface environmental systems. My education includes degrees in chemical engineering and civil engineering, alongside a PhD from Queen’s University in Canada, where my doctoral research focused on gas generation during thermal remediation of contaminated aquifers. Before moving into full-time academia, I worked in environmental regulation and field operations—first as a subject matter expert and later as a Provincial Officer with the Ontario Ministry of the Environment. My work involved compliance audits, site investigations, and remediation oversight across both industrial and remote northern regions. I’ve also worked as an environmental scientist in the Canadian high Arctic.

Since transitioning into academia, I’ve taught at Queen’s University, the University of Birmingham, and most recently, after relocated to the UK permanently in 2024, the University of Greenwich, where I serve as Programme Leader for the MSc Civil Engineering (Water, Waste and Environmental Engineering). My teaching experience spans both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, with a focus on environmental systems, hydrological modelling, and digital integration. I have designed and delivered modules on contaminant hydrogeology, hydrosystems engineering, environmental chemistry, water resources, and civil engineering research skills. Earlier in my career, I also taught numerical methods and engineering computing, bringing experience with MATLAB, MODFLOW, and statistical modelling tools into the classroom. I supervise projects focused on contaminant transport, porous media modelling, and environmental classification using machine learning. I also collaborate with the British Geological Survey and currently serve as Principal Investigator for a national-scale research sprint at The Alan Turing Institute, where I lead a project on sequential SAR image analysis for environmental hazard detection. Across these courses, I have prioritised structured delivery, scaffolded learning, and tool selection that supports both conceptual clarity and practical skill development.

Throughout, digital tools have remained part of my working lexicon, not as a separate career field, but as an inextricable part of how I teach, supervise, and solve problems. I use them where they extend capacity, where they open up exploratory space, or where they allow students and collaborators to go deeper than manual methods would allow. My approach to TEL practice is pragmatic, embedded, and shaped by both regulatory discipline and educational care.

My relationship with technology began early. I was six when I first laid my fingers on the keyboard of a classroom Apple IIe. The impact was immediate and permanent. It wasn’t just the novelty. It was possibility, agency, scale. That moment shaped how I saw learning from then on. 

Within a few years, I found myself at a programming camp, learning the fundamentals of BASIC and in highschool reveled in classes that required me to apply Object-Oriented Turing (OOT) or hard-coded HTML markup. An early start shaped how I approached technology when I began teaching as a Teaching Assistant in 2007, then Adjunct Lectuere in 2017 after the completion of my doctorate. My first classrooms were still equipped with blackboards and acetates, but they were already transitioning to PowerPoint, smartboards, and digital handouts. I uploaded materials and marked submissions from day one using Moodle, which was later replaced by D2L and then Canvas. I ran tutorials using Excel, FORTRAN, MATLAB, MODFLOW, and Python;  The tools that fits the engineering and educational goasl best. As an educator, having the right tool for the problem was never about novelty. It was about fit. I’ve always tried to assess the learning context first, then choose tools that sharpen thinking, support rigour, and help students go further than they otherwise could.


**Why CMALT?**

I am applying for CMALT because it is a well-regarded qualification that reflects thoughtful, critical engagement with technology in education. While my work is situated in engineering rather than dedicated learning technology, the core values of CMALT align closely with how I teach and supervise. These include evidence-based practice, reflective development, and a commitment to student learning. This portfolio offers a chance to consolidate over a decade of technology-enhanced practice and to frame that work more formally within the evolving professional landscape. I see this process not only as recognition. It is also a way to connect with peers across disciplines who are thinking seriously about how we use digital tools to extend learning, not just support it.
