**<h2 id="Core_Area_1">Preface</h2>a) Understanding Constraints and Benefits of different technologies**

***<h2 id="Core_Area_1_a">Preface</h2>Case i: Platform Logic and Pedagogical Choice - Mentimeter, Panopto, and Moodle***

I first used Moodle at Queen’s University in the early 2010s. At that time, it relied heavily on folder structures and lacked visual clarity. In 2017–2019, I moved to D2L, which introduced conditional release logic, advanced quiz functions, and integrated assessment flows. While flexible, its complexity often outweighed its benefits for straightforward module delivery.

In 2021, I taught using Canvas at the University of Birmingham. It offered stronger integration with Turnitin and had a cleaner interface, but its rigid module sequencing and auto-generated calendar features limited flexibility mid-term.

Since 2024, I’ve been using Moodle again at the University of Greenwich. I rebuilt asynchronous delivery shells to support hybrid teaching and make lectures resilient to disruption. Each shell followed a standard format: one section per week, clear session titles, downloadable PDFs, and no folder nesting. I deliberately excluded “completion tracking” features, having observed in past modules that students began to treat the course as a checklist rather than an intellectual process. Navigational friction and overcomplexity were stripped out wherever possible.

Panopto recordings were produced for every lecture but explicitly framed as review material. I regularly reminded students that the recordings were not substitutes for engagement or participation; they were scaffolds useful for reinforcement, revisiting worked examples, or catching up when circumstances prevented attendance. Recordings were not segmented or heavily edited. Their utility came from immediacy, not production value.

The main constraints across platforms involved layout rigidity, content management overhead, and poor adaptation to mobile use. The benefits included reliable content access, multimodal recording, and integrated assessment workflows. My platform use was shaped by a consistent aim: to reduce ambiguity and ensure students could locate and use core materials without distraction.

***Case ii: Jupyter Notebooks for Engineering Education: Supporting Conceptual Mastery***

As part of my module redevelopment for Contaminant Hydrogeology and Groundwater Remediation and Hydrosystems Engineering and Management, I have integrated interactive Jupyter notebooks developed by TU Dresden through the iNUX Europe initiative and <a href="https://gw-project.org/interactive-education/">The Groundwater Project – Interactive Education</a>. These notebooks shift traditionally lecture-based content into exploratory, browser-accessible environments where students can interact directly with groundwater models, parameterise scenarios, and visualise results.

To enable seamless deployment, I configured Moodle shell links through Binder and JupyterHub pipelines, removing the need for local installation or advanced setup. This scaffolding supports digital equity and accessibility across diverse student hardware and skill levels. The aim is to increase engagement while aligning learning activities with Bloom’s higher-order skills: application, analysis, and evaluation.

The notebooks replace multi-step pen-and-paper tasks with responsive tools that allow full control of key variables. By doing so, they preserve cognitive rigour while reducing procedural friction, supporting a deeper conceptual grasp of transient flow, sorption, and transport processes. Although student-facing use begins in 2025–2026, internal testing has confirmed full compatibility, and I have produced draft screencasts and tutorial guides in preparation for launch.

These materials form part of a broader effort to reorient groundwater teaching around open-source tools and reproducible science, with colleagues across the faculty already expressing interest in adaptation for their modules.


***Case iii: SYMPLE and INUX Europe: Leading Collaborative EdTech Deployment***

As a curriculum developer and trainer for SYMPLE, I collaborate with colleagues from TU Dresden and Sapienza University of Rome to produce applied hydrogeology materials for
use in under-resourced regions. This work foregrounds scalable, decision-focused education in groundwater systems and expands my own practice in adapting teaching to diverse technical
and environmental settings. Part of my work with SYMPLE included the development of adn online learning platform, the <a href="https://tu-dresden.de/bu/umwelt/hydro/inux/projekt/ueberblick?set_language=en">iNUX project (Interactive understanding of groundwater hydrogeology and groundwater management)</a>, which is an Erasmus+ funded initiative (2022–2025), led by a collaboration between institutions including the Technical University of Dresden, University of Gothenburg and Universidad Politécnica de Cataluña.

The goal of the project is to produce open‑source teaching materials—interactive videos, Jupyter Notebooks, self‑assessment tasks—designed to support educators and students in teaching groundwater science at a European and global level. The materials are <a href="https://github.com/gw-inux"> freely available via GitHub</a> and include instructions for contributing and adapting content to local contexts. My role in the development of this open-access Hydrogeological question bank which required data-wranging, classification by Bloom's Taxonomy, subject matter and difficulty,testing and deployment of subject matter.
