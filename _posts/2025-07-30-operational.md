## Preface

## a) Understanding Constraints and Benefits of different technologies
### i) Platform Logic and Pedagogical Choice: Mentimeter, Panopto, and Moodle
I first encountered Moodle while teaching at Queen’s University in the early 2010s. It was serviceable but awkward, built around folders and click-depth rather than clarity. By 2017, I had shifted to D2L, which offered more flexibility in conditional release and quiz logic, but also introduced complexity that often exceeded the needs of a course. At the University of Birmingham in 2021, I worked with Canvas. It offered a cleaner design and better integration with Turnitin, but its default structures—auto-generated calendars, rigid sequencing that often clashed with term schedules. Now, in 2024, I find myself back in Moodle at Greenwich. It has changed little. The scroll-of-death remains. The folder logic remains. The editing pane is still buried in a settings menu. It feels less like a platform that has evolved, and more like one that has survived.

At Greenwich, I built a asynchronous delivery framework inside Moodle to support hybrid lectures and increase resilience during periods of staff or student absence. The shell design was intentionally sparse—one section per week, clearly labelled sessions, downloadable PDFs rather than embedded documents, and minimal folder nesting. I avoided Moodle’s “completion tracking” feature, having observed in past modules that students began to treat the course as a checklist rather than an intellectual process. Navigational friction and overcomplexity were stripped out wherever possible.

Panopto recordings were produced for every lecture but explicitly framed as review material. I regularly reminded students that the recordings were not substitutes for engagement or participation; they were scaffolds useful for reinforcement, revisiting worked examples, or catching up when circumstances prevented attendance. Recordings were not segmented or heavily edited. Their utility came from immediacy, not production value.

Across all these platforms, I made selective use of available features rather than adopting tools wholesale. The VLEs differed in interface and logic, but the core constraint was the same: a platform’s structure is not the pedagogy. The work lay in minimising distraction, reducing ambiguity, and keeping students oriented on the learning, not the interface.
