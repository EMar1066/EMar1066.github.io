## Preface

## a) Understanding Constraints and Benefits of different technologies
### i) Platform Logic and Pedagogical Choice: Mentimeter, Panopto, and Moodle

I first used Moodle at Queen’s University in the early 2010s. At that time, it relied heavily on folder structures and lacked visual clarity. In 2017–2019, I moved to D2L, which introduced conditional release logic, advanced quiz functions, and integrated assessment flows. While flexible, its complexity often outweighed its benefits for straightforward module delivery.

In 2021, I taught using Canvas at the University of Birmingham. It offered stronger integration with Turnitin and had a cleaner interface, but its rigid module sequencing and auto-generated calendar features limited flexibility mid-term.

Since 2023, I’ve been using Moodle again at the University of Greenwich. I rebuilt asynchronous delivery shells to support hybrid teaching and make lectures resilient to disruption. Each shell followed a standard format: one section per week, clear session titles, downloadable PDFs, and no folder nesting. I deliberately excluded “completion tracking,” which in previous courses had encouraged checklist behaviours rather than conceptual learning.

Lecture recordings were delivered via Panopto. All lectures were recorded with voice, slides, smartboard and captions. These were integrated into Moodle for reference and review, but clearly signposted as supplemental, not primary, learning materials.

The main constraints across platforms involved layout rigidity, content management overhead, and poor adaptation to mobile use. The benefits included reliable content access, multimodal recording, and integrated assessment workflows. My platform use was shaped by a consistent aim: to reduce ambiguity and ensure students could locate and use core materials without distraction.
