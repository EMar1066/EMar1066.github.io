## Preface

**: Facilitating Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration: The Alan Turing Institute Data Study Groups**

The Alan Turing Institute’s Data Study Groups (DSGs) are intensive, collaborative research sprints where teams of early-career (PhD and postdoctoral) researchers work on real-world data challenges posed by external partners, including government bodies, research institutes, and industry. As a facilitator for The Alan Turing Institute’s Data Study Groups (Septemeber 2024 and January 2025), I mentored and lead interdisciplinary teams of early-career researchers working on rapid Machine Learning (ML) and data science methods prototyping for applied environmental problems.

The September 2024 project, delivered through the Alan Turing Institute’s Data Study Group in partnership with the British Geological Survey (BGS), developed a modular machine learning pipeline for automated analysis of petrographic thin-section images, supporting early-stage CCS and hydrogen storage site selection. The team explored porosity estimation using pixel-level colour filtering, grain segmentation via watershed algorithms, and mineral classification with both feature-based random forests and U-Net convolutional networks. As facilitator, I contributed to project design, research direction, and implementation strategy. The challenge addressed a national need for scalable, reproducible assessment of archived geological samples—over 500,000 thin sections at BGS alone—moving beyond manual, subjective workflows. The development team included postgraduate and postdoctoral researchers from across the UK and Europe.

The January 2025 project, delivered through the Alan Turing Institute’s Data Study Group in partnership with the BGS, focused on automating the interpretation of legacy seismic scan data for shallow gas detection. The challenge addressed the digitisation and analysis of deteriorated paper records using structure-preserving image enhancement, OCR-based shotpoint detection, and multi-stage deep learning pipelines for feature segmentation. I served as co-facilitator for the challenge, leading the image enhancement pipeline design, supporting the object detection architecture, and contributing to the theoretical framework and report delivery. A follow-on phase is currently under consideration to integrate the OCR and segmentation modules into a deployable national screening tool for shallow gas hazard mitigation. 

I am currently serving as Principal Investigator for the September 2025 Data Study Group challenge in partnership with CEFAS (Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science), focusing on oil leak detection from shipwrecks using sequential Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. My responsibilities include challenge design, literature synthesis, coordination with the CEFAS data team, and alignment of technical aims with stakeholder priorities across Turing, CEFAS, and participating researchers. The project addresses the absence of time-aware SAR segmentation methods in environmental monitoring, aiming to integrate temporal models (e.g., ConvLSTM, transformer-based architectures) with environmental priors such as wind vectors and spill source proximity. I lead the collaborative framing process, working with facilitators and Turing programme staff to finalise deliverables and ensure the sprint supports both research innovation and policy-relevant outcomes. The event is currently in pre-sprint preparation, with delivery scheduled for Autumn 2025.
