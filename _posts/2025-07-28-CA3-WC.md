## Preface

**GDPR and Data Ethics in Digital Education: Insights from Turing DSG**

As Principal Investigator for the September 2025 Turing Data Study Group challenge, I hold formal responsibility not only for the scientific direction and educational value of the project, but also for ensuring ethical and legal compliance with the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK GDPR. This includes authoring and clearing the project ethics submission under the Alan Turing Institute’s TREx framework, which is mandatory for all Eligible Research involving the Institute. Every DSG challenge requires a detailed ethics submission (TREx Form 1 and 2), documenting risk mitigation, data provenance, and alignment with both institutional and legal standards. My work is guided by the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/turing-research-ethics-policy-trex-0">The Alan Turing Institute Research Ethics Policy (TREx)</a>, and enforce by <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research-misconduct-policy">The Alan Turing Institute Research Misconduct Policy</a>, ensuring that data handling, risk assessment, and transparency requirements are met throughout the project lifecycle.


ShowsFocus: Data privacy, AI ethics, student/staff consent, transparency in AI-assisted teaching tools.**
