## Preface

This section outlines my role as facilitator and Principal Investigator across three Data Study Groups (DSGs) run by The Alan Turing Institute. These events bring researchers and practitioners together around live technical challenges posed by partner organisations. My responsibilities include early-stage design, technical framing, and leadership during the sprint itself.

The work is interdisciplinary and applied. Each challenge must be scoped to ensure methodological relevance, tractable research directions, and space for meaningful contribution. Partner organisations must gain insight. Participants must be able to engage, regardless of background. This requires careful planning, critical review of the field, and the construction of a collaborative environment that rewards clarity, reasoning, and intellectual risk.

This work is both technical and pedagogical. DSGs are designed to produce applied research outputs, but they also function as learning environments. They support skill development, shared vocabulary, and confidence across levels of experience. The following section reflects on this work, and its relationship to my wider teaching and research practice.


## Specialist Option: Building Technologically-Driven Learning Environments: From Tools to Leadership

As facilitator and now Principal Investigator across three Alan Turing Institute Data Study Groups (DSGs), my role has been to design and lead collaborative technical challenges that balance research credibility, educational value, and strategic delivery. These events are not merely hackathons or proof-of-concept sprints; they are structured environments for interdisciplinary learning, problem solving, and real-world application.

In the September 2024 DSG with the British Geological Survey (BGS), I facilitated a team working on carbonate reservoir screening for carbon capture and storage. The dataset consisted of petrographic thin-sections, and I helped shape the project scope, advised on suitable deep learning architectures (e.g. U-Net for segmentation), and ensured the team’s approach remained relevant to national storage needs. I also helped steer group dynamics, encouraged equitable task division, and provided technical mentoring across coding, mineralogical interpretation, and feature engineering. The Turing insitute DSG organisational staff said:


> (Evidence 1) I can tell you are already bringing a lot of value to the challenge.


>(Evidence 2) It was great meeting you and working with you. I just saw your message on slack and wanted to thank you for your kind words and your input. You helped us a lot by kickstarting the project and making sure the team was cohesive in working until we found our footing and got to know each other.


In the January 2025 DSG, I served as co-facilitator on a remote challenge focused on legacy seismic scan interpretation. My design contribution included developing a pre-processing workflow for structure-preserving enhancement and designing a hybrid object detection and segmentation pipeline. The challenge had high uncertainty and weak labels. My leadership focus was not only on the technical pipeline but also on managing ambiguity, distributing cognitive load, and maintaining morale in a time-zoned, virtual team.  The events have been of great interest to my colleagues, where I have promoted the DSG and the utility o

>(Evidence 3) Thank you for taking part of this wonderful event! I might invite you in the future if that is okay to share your experience with colleagues. I’d like to encourage more staff to get involved with the Alan Turing Institute.

For the upcoming September 2025 DSG with Cefas, I am leading as Principal Investigator. This involves dataset validation, research scoping, challenge framing, and team design. The topic, detecting oil spills from shipwrecks using SAR time series, has no existing solution template. I led a six-month literature review to locate research gaps and now provide participants with a scaffolded framework, including distinct methodological tracks (e.g., ConvLSTM, temporal transformers, lightweight segmentation) while keeping the challenge modular and adaptable. I am further encouraged by feedback from my Turing Institute colleagues:

> (Evidence 5) You are very loved by our DSG team, so I do hope this challenge would fit into your area.

> (Evidence 6) I admired your work ethic and how you approached the challenge. The whole DSG was a learning experience in which you contributed a lot. Thank you, hope our paths cross again as well. Best of luck in the new academic year!

At each stage, I provide design leadership: building challenge frameworks that are technically open, yet pedagogically scaffolded; curating interdisciplinary cohesion; and ensuring each DSG serves the research partner, the Institute, and the participants equally.

**Specialist Option Reflection**

Leadership in this context is architectural as well as instructional. My influence primarily lies in curating the environment where outcomes become possible. Each DSG requires anticipatory thinking: What dead ends are likely? What skills will participants bring? What will they need on Day 2 when early ideas collapse? The design must account for exploration, missteps, and re-orientation.

I’ve learned that good challenge design thrives on pluralism: Providing multiple valid paths rather than one intended solution. Framing must be deliberate but flexible. Participants need just enough structure to proceed confidently, but enough freedom to surprise us. When this balance is struck, something powerful happens: people contribute beyond their discipline, they teach each other, and they produce both solutions and academic insight.

What sets DSGs apart, and what aligns them with my wider educational philosophy, is the combination of urgency and learning. Participants live the project. They struggle, argue, resolve, and build. They leave not with a mark or grade, but with a new capacity for cross-disciplinary work. My leadership makes that possible not through authority, but through design.

Feedback from participants and Turing staff confirms the value of this design-led leadership:

The influence of these DSG experiences is not confined to research challenges. I have translated these methods and insights directly into my teaching and graduate supervision. My MSc students now regularly work in collaborative GitHub environments, engaging with real-world datasets and exploratory pipelines in environmental modelling. I build modular scaffolds that allow them to explore, adapt, and contribute, not unlike DSG participants.

Moreover, I structure student projects with the same attention to resilience, pluralism, and feedback loops. My postgraduate mentorship echoes the DSG ethos: task design that rewards iteration, encourages interdisciplinary curiosity, and sustains momentum through thoughtful framing. DSGs have sharpened not just my technical fluency but my pedagogical clarity. They have made me a better architect of learning.
