## Preface

Each DSG requires the careful balancing of three imperatives: institutional, industrial, and educational. The Alan Turing Institute rightly expects intellectual rigour, clear framing, and technical feasibility. The partner organisation—whether British Geological Survey (BGS) or Cefas—needs useful, exploratory outputs grounded in their domain context. The participants need a project that stretches them, includes them, and allows for meaningful contribution regardless of discipline, seniority, or coding confidence.

As a facilitator and now PI, I’m responsible for the construction and curation of this space.

This means six months of advance work before the challenge ever begins: identifying datasets, scoping potential research pathways, surveying the current state of the field, and deliberately not prescribing one solution. I study the literature, locate the underexplored edges, and then frame a set of modular, tractable directions that support novelty and collaboration. These aren't toy problems. Each challenge has immediate relevance: national CCS screening, legacy seismic reinterpretation for offshore wind development, or probabilistic modelling of marine oil slicks. But they’re also pedagogical laboratories. They are designed to teach—not through lectures, but through doing.


## Specialist Option

***Specialist Option: : Building Technologically-Driven Learning Environments: From Tools to Leadership**

As facilitator and now Principal Investigator across three Alan Turing Institute Data Study Groups (DSGs), my role has been to design and lead collaborative technical challenges that balance research credibility, educational value, and strategic delivery. These events are not merely hackathons or proof-of-concept sprints; they are structured environments for interdisciplinary learning, problem solving, and real-world application.

In the September 2024 DSG with the British Geological Survey (BGS), I facilitated a team working on carbonate reservoir screening for carbon capture and storage. The dataset consisted of petrographic thin-sections, and I helped shape the project scope, advised on suitable deep learning architectures (e.g. U-Net for segmentation), and ensured the team’s approach remained relevant to national storage needs. I also helped steer group dynamics, encouraged equitable task division, and provided technical mentoring across coding, mineralogical interpretation, and feature engineering.

In the January 2025 DSG, I served as co-facilitator on a remote challenge focused on legacy seismic scan interpretation. My design contribution included developing a pre-processing workflow for structure-preserving enhancement and designing a hybrid object detection and segmentation pipeline. The challenge had high uncertainty and weak labels. My leadership focus was not only on the technical pipeline but also on managing ambiguity, distributing cognitive load, and maintaining morale in a time-zoned, virtual team.

For the upcoming September 2025 DSG with Cefas, I am leading as Principal Investigator. This involves dataset validation, research scoping, challenge framing, and team design. The topic—detecting oil spills from shipwrecks using SAR time series—has no existing template. I led a six-month literature review to locate research gaps and now provide participants with a scaffolded framework, including distinct methodological tracks (e.g., ConvLSTM, temporal transformers, lightweight segmentation) while keeping the challenge modular and adaptable.

At each stage, I provide design leadership: building challenge frameworks that are technically open, yet pedagogically scaffolded; curating interdisciplinary cohesion; and ensuring each DSG serves the research partner, the Institute, and the participants equally.

**Reflection**

Leadership in this context is not instructional but architectural. My influence lies not in directing outcomes but in curating the environment where outcomes become possible. Each DSG requires anticipatory thinking: What dead ends are likely? What skills will participants bring? What will they need on Day 2 when early ideas collapse? The design must account for exploration, missteps, and re-orientation.

I’ve learned that good challenge design thrives on pluralism—providing multiple valid paths rather than one intended solution. Framing must be deliberate but flexible. Participants need just enough structure to proceed confidently, but enough freedom to surprise us. When this balance is struck, something powerful happens: people contribute beyond their discipline, they teach each other, and they produce not just solutions, but insight.

What sets DSGs apart—and what aligns them with my wider educational philosophy—is the combination of urgency and learning. Participants live the project. They struggle, argue, resolve, and build. They leave not with a mark or grade, but with a new capacity for cross-disciplinary work. My leadership makes that possible not through authority, but through design.

Feedback from participants and Turing staff confirms the value of this design-led leadership:

> You are very loved by our DSG team, so I do hope this challenge would fit into your area.


> (Evidence 1) I can tell you are already bringing a lot of value to the challenge.

> (Evidence 2) Thank you for taking part of this wonderful event! I might invite you in the future if that is okay to share your experience with colleagues. I’d like to encourage more staff to get involved with the Alan Turing Institute.

> (Evidence 3) I admired your work ethic and how you approached the challenge. The whole DSG was a learning experience in which you contributed a lot. Thank you, hope our paths cross again as well. Best of luck in the new academic year!

> (Evidence 4) It was great meeting you and working with you. I just saw your message on slack and wanted to thank you for your kind words and your input. You helped us a lot by kickstarting the project and making sure the team was cohesive in working until we found our footing and got to know each other.

The influence of these DSG experiences is not confined to research challenges. I have translated these methods and insights directly into my teaching and graduate supervision. My MSc students now regularly work in collaborative GitHub environments, engaging with real-world datasets and exploratory pipelines in environmental modelling. I build modular scaffolds that allow them to explore, adapt, and contribute—not unlike DSG participants.

Moreover, I structure student projects with the same attention to resilience, pluralism, and feedback loops. My postgraduate mentorship echoes the DSG ethos: task design that rewards iteration, encourages interdisciplinary curiosity, and sustains momentum through thoughtful framing. DSGs have sharpened not just my technical fluency but my pedagogical clarity. They have made me a better architect of learning.
