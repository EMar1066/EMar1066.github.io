## Preface

This Specialist Option focuses on my current role as Principal Investigator for a national Data Study Group challenge with The Alan Turing Institute and Cefas. The project focuses on using ML/AI methods to detect oil leaks from shipwrecks using time-series satellite data, is underway, and presents a task that is technical, pedagogical, strategic, and environmental.

I am actively designing the problem space others will enter: Structuring a multi-day rapid prototypinmg challenge for PhD and Postdoctoral participants that is computationally rigorous, open-ended yet coherent, and deeply grounded in physical meaning and impact. The goal is to model oil spills and at the same time, to create an educational framework in which interdisciplinary contributors can learn, build, and reason through complexity.

>-(Evidence 1) I can tell you are already bringing a lot of value to the challenge.

>(Evidence 2) Thank you for taking part of this wonderful event! I might invite you in the future if that is okay to share your experience with colleagues. I’d like to encourage more staff to get involved with the Alan Turing Institute.

>(Evidence 3) I admired your work ethic and how you approached the challenge. The whole DSG was a learning experience in which you contributed a lot. Thank you, hope our paths cross again as well. Best of luck in the new academic year!


>(Evidence 4) It was great meeting you and working with you. I just saw your message on slack and wanted to thank you for your kind words and your input. You helped us a lot by kickstarting the project and making sure the team was cohesive in working until we found our footing and got to know each other.
